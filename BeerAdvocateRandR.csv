1,Breakfast Stout,4.25,
2,Breakfast Stout,4.94,Amazing taste for a dark stout beer!
3,Breakfast Stout,5.0,"Well, well, well, well, well. Stout lovers of the world, unite and take over."
4,Breakfast Stout,4.2,"Had on tap at Bulldog Saloon Lynnwood, WA."
5,Breakfast Stout,3.61,"I'm rating this based off of the Kentucky Breakfast Stout drop, BeerAdvocate says it's retired but I just grabbed a pack of them last week. It is SARCASTICALLY chocolate, perfect amount of coffee in my personal opinion, but the chocolate is objectively overwhelming. I love this whenever I'm really in the mood for something rich, but any other time it's a bit much. Great specialty beer."
6,Breakfast Stout,3.84,"Almost pure black with a small tan head. The bubbles dissipate pretty fast, leaving just a few smaller ones and some lacing.

Very strong coffee smell. There is a hint of chocolate, helping to balance things a bit

Not surprisingly, there is a strong coffee note up front, then the chocolate sweetness kicks in. There is a lingering bitterness at the finish.

It is a bit thinner than expected, mostly carbonation on the tongue.

I can see how this is the base for the KBS beers, it is pretty solid. With so much coffee flavor, I'd consider this a dessert beer. It's good, but I definitely prefer the KBS variants."

11,Breakfast Stout,4.0,"Pours a great thick black with a nice head that does hang around throughout the drink, smells of coffee with a slight sweetness... black coffee with one sugar. has a medium mouth feel, tastes of bitter coffee, maybe over roasted coffee but does give off a good feeling of a nice early morning cup of joe"
12,Breakfast Stout,4.49,"12 ounce bottle, poured after warming for 30 minutes, into a Founders snifter.
Dark mud coffee black, fine dense brown head that recedes slowly.
Aroma of Italian roast ground coffee beans and cafe Cubano. A chocolate note too.
Wickedly tasty, leads right off with the coffee. Then char and dark chocolate run around like a marble in the mouth. Finishes mildly sweet, then slightly bitter and dry. 
Oats delivers a fine creamy smoothness. Medium carbonation.
Overall, a beautiful expression of brewing creativity and truly an ‘anytime’ treat."
13,Breakfast Stout,4.4,
14,Breakfast Stout,2.73,"I love coffee. I love stouts. I love oatmeal stouts. I usually love coffee stouts. Given all that, I expected to love the #2 oatmeal stout in the world according to the current ranking. Unfortunately, I didn’t. The coffee smell is above average, but the taste is overly bitter and mostly just reminds me of bad coffee that was roasted far too long. This one is not for me."
15,Breakfast Stout,4.29,
16,Breakfast Stout,4.5,
17,Breakfast Stout,4.19,
18,Breakfast Stout,4.75,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.

Appearance: Very dark brown, nearly black, with a dark tan head so thick that it required multiple gradual pourings to prevent overflowing the glass. Moderate lacing.

Nose: Dark roast, stone fruit, brown sugar, coffee — there’s a lot going on here.

Mouthfeel: Creamy, moderately thick.

Attack: Dark roast, coffee, chocolate, smooth — plenty going on here, too.

Finish: Alcohol, and bitterness from the dark roast that balances everything wonderfully.

Overall: It’s hard to imagine how an American Oatmeal Stout could be any better than this — so full, smooth, and well-balanced. There’s nothing I’d rather drink with Biscuits and Gravy, but it’s also going very well this morning with goetta and scrambled eggs. This beer deserves every bit of its high ratings."
19,Breakfast Stout,4.39,"Poured into a nonic glass at about fridge temp, but letting warm up.

Pours dark black with a tall almost gusher tan head. 4

Aroma is big and strong, roasty coffee and a touch of sweetness. 4.25

Again, strong and just bitter enough black coffee, some dark and roasty malts and lingering slightly bitter finish. 4.5

Smooth body and very easily drinkable for the higher abv, no sign of booze or burn, but a bit warming in the chest as I keep sipping. 4.25"
20,90 Minute IPA,4.83,
21,90 Minute IPA,4.46,
22,90 Minute IPA,4.82,"Perfect example of an IPA. 

One of the best ""mainstream"" IPAs out there"
23,90 Minute IPA,3.16,
24,90 Minute IPA,4.89,"What’s not to like? Amazing flavors, mouthfeel and great abv. A truly enjoyable beverage"
25,90 Minute IPA,3.78,
26,90 Minute IPA,5.0,"Type: IPA
Taste: Intense, balanced, and hop-forward
Color: Deep amber

A standout example of the IPA style. Pours a deep amber, intense and well balanced.
Strong hop, blends pine, citrus and resinous hops. Memorable impression. One of my favourites."
27,90 Minute IPA,4.72,I came across this on a recent rail tour of the US. It’s available in the cafe car on most of Amtrak’s long distance services. It looks like there’s no requirement to state the abv of beers at the point of sale as I didn’t realise it was 9% til I had the first sip! Lovely stuff though sadly not available in the UK.
28,90 Minute IPA,4.51,
29,90 Minute IPA,5.0,One of my favorite dipa ish IPAs. It has a wonderful full bodied dipa taste but doesn't hit you like a higher alcohol ipa. I love the higher ibu that seems to be lacking in many ipa's these days.
30,90 Minute IPA,3.1,"Look: sap color orange
Smell: hoppy, malty, slightly citrusy and piney hop
Taste: piney hop, rind/pithe, malt, some sweetness in there, slight bitterness that starts to build up but then just kinda doesnt (if that makes any sense)
Feel: Nice full boy, low carbonation (the feel of this beer might be my favorite thing about it)
Overall: Pretty crushable, fairly tame, nothing too offensive. That being said, nothing stands out, but I suppose you could also say that just means its well balanced. Not my cup for IPA's, but good 

*poured from a can on clearance that ""expires"" in 4 months, so I def think this needs a revisit with a fresh brew."
31,90 Minute IPA,3.11,"Pours an opaque rusty orange, thin collar of head with good retention and no lacing. Nose is sappy hops and malt, low grade maple syrup, cooked barley and kasha, honey sticks. Taste essentially follows - malts are sweet (honey, maple, sap), while the hops impart a pretty tame bitterness and light spice. Mouthfeel, despite the sweetness and heft, isn't too heavy, while the carbonation stays light. 90 Minute tastes like an ingredient to me - it has a distinct taste (sweet, spicy, sappy honey) - that might make up the main seasoner in a muffin or a sweet bread. On its own, however, it's a little too overpowering to be enjoyable. I remember 90 minute being this huge outlier when it came out, and weirdly, it still is in terms of its flavor profile among imperial IPAs."
32,90 Minute IPA,4.53,"Very smooth almost chewy. My 1st time with this world class IPA today and I am impressed. The alcohol is there and you should be prepared for it, but overall the taste smell finish and mouth feel was excellent"
33,90 Minute IPA,4.04,
34,90 Minute IPA,4.09,
35,90 Minute IPA,4.59,"From Siciliano’s Market in Grand Rapids - had several times but now a few years - will not wait that long again.
Pours a clear orange amber colour with slightly tawny coloured head that replenishes nicely with a little swirl.
Nose is at once hoppy with citrus rind, tangerine, a touch of tropical fruit and floral aroma , but solidly malty with a subtle caramel note.
Taste is a barrage of hops - piney, citrus, orange, pineapple and marmalade with a bitterness that is tamed by the sweet toasted malt with hints of caramel and honeysuckle.
A sticky slightly resinous full mouthfeel finishes this with a coating bittersweetness."
36,90 Minute IPA,4.81,"Easily my favorite imperial IPA and possibly IPA period.

Pours a beautiful crystal clear amber color with a tan-white head that long persists as a rim.

Aroma is very strongly floral and earthy.

Despite being rated as 90 IBUs this is not a bitter beer thanks to the adequate amount of malt being added to balance the hops. The flavor is citrusy and earth with a crisp finish, making this an easy drinking beer despite its high ABV.

Really just the ideal poster child for the style of IPAs as a whole."
37,90 Minute IPA,4.21,"12 ounce bottle poured into a snulip.
Best by 7/2023

L: Clear amber, two fingers of antique-white head, the persistent foam leaves lace.
S: Kind of a malty aroma with notes of citrus and pine.
T: Earthy hops with less citrus than the nose but grapefruit and pine, medium sweet malt, herbal tea note, nice malt-hop balance, moderate bitterness spikes at the finish. 
F: Medium body, moderate carbonation, smooth frothy feel, peppery finish.
O: Very drinkable, balanced, well done classic style DIPA."

40,Two Hearted IPA,4.27,"Not too hoppy, just as good room temperature as ice cold.
Better from bottle. Wife doesn’t like it so it’s my go-to beer when camping.
Reasonably priced in my area."
41,Two Hearted IPA,3.9,"12oz can with date code 062823. Served in a pint glass. Bit coppery color, orange amber, with a thick white head. Very nice start. Old school AIPA aromas of citrus and maybe some pine. Really substantial mouthfeel owing to a solid malt backbone with some crystal malts along with a creamy load of carbonation. Maybe even oats in the mash? But anyway, this is an IPA, and it brings along a very reasonable level of bitterness and piny goodness. Makes me think of Dogfish 60 minute in terms of flavor profile, turned up just a little bit, but not as far as 90.

I've been hearing about this middle-of-the-country beer for years and I'm not disappointed having finally tried it!"
42,Two Hearted IPA,3.58,A staple if you will. Gets better as it warms. Decent IPA. Not too much hops.
43,Two Hearted IPA,5.1,
44,Two Hearted IPA,3.51,"Not a huge IPA guy, this was ok. A little too hoppy. Won’t buy again"
45,Two Hearted IPA,4.57,"Wonderful medium-strength IPA with beautiful and nicely balanced flavors of pine and tropical fruits. Ideal for winter/fall as this beer will warm your souls. A bit heavy for warm days, can feel like a meal."
46,Two Hearted IPA,9.48,
47,Two Hearted IPA,4.51,
48,Two Hearted IPA,4.36,"An American pale ale at its most defining characteristic. I’ve grown to love centennial hops and this seems to be available at many stores which, as much as I love local craft brews (especially around Chicago, like 3 Floyds and Revolution), distribution is key for a transient graduate student as myself who loves consistent tasty beers at reasonable prices. This beer holds its freshness compared to other American IPAs which need to be consumed within 6-8 weeks."

50,Two Hearted IPA,4.3,
51,Two Hearted IPA,4.09,
52,Two Hearted IPA,4.5,"Bells Two Hearted is a classic IPA that I can't be mad at. It's the kind of beer that I'll happily buy at a bar and not be disappointed. The look of the beer is see through. The smell is mostly a classic balance of hops and malt. The taste and feel is nothing different. There are only a few IPAs that I like better because they have more West Coast hops, but this beer is as reliable and classic as it comes."
53,Two Hearted IPA,4.53,"Pours a rich gold color, clear with a foamy white head. Smells a little of pine bitterness. Taste is well balanced, caramel malt flavor with a dry bitter finish."
54,Two Hearted IPA,4.71,
55,Two Hearted IPA,5.0,For many years I've read about how good this beer is...but it wasn't available. About 2 weeks ago I found it at a local store in the 22 oz can section and couldn't believe my eyes. YES..this beer lives up to all the rave reviews. In a world where there are so many great IPAs...this one stands out.
56,Two Hearted IPA,4.66,So darn good had to force it down my mama's throat!
57,Two Hearted IPA,4.0,
58,Two Hearted IPA,4.39,"L - Golden with a good amount of clarity and a white head that sticks around a bit, leaving behind a thin cap and some lacing 
S - juicy, piney, floral hops along with bright tropical fruit notes along with citrus, some malt 
T - juicy, piney, floral hops up front intermixed well with tropical fruit notes - pineapple, passion fruit, some citrus, along with crackery malt 
F - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Juicy
O - a very well balanced, classic IPA"

S - Bright, floral piney hops along with notes of citrus zest
T - Follows the nose: bright, fresh, floral, pine, slightly bitter hops up front and throughout intermixed well with notes of citrus - candied grapefruit, orange zest - cracker malt, a little bit of honey, grass notes 
F - light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation - bright, fresh, crispy - very clean 
O - one of the benchmarks for the West Coast IPA style. Incredibly well balanced and easy to drink. Glad to have finally gotten my hands on it"

64,Pliny The Elder,4.25,"Served in an imperial nonic pint glass

This beer pours a golden hue and is topped with a couple inches of off-white head that leaves nice lacing.

It has a real nice fruity citrus aroma. I get a little pine. 

Nice balance of citrus and pine flavors. A little bit of lingering resin in the finish

Very good IIPA. It's one of the pioneers. As with all trailblazers newer and better beers come along. I live in Ohio and am very happy that I can drink Hop Juju. Someday it, too, will be a trailblazer in the rear-view mirror of my lifelong beer trek."

69,Pliny The Elder,5.0,Pliny is really difficult to find in Southern Cal but I finally tried one for the first time at the Russian River brew pub in Santa Rosa. It was on tap so super fresh. I think it is probably the most well balanced DIPA I ever tried. I now understand the hype!

80,Heady Topper,4.83,
81,Heady Topper,4.96,"For me this is the GOAT. Don’t want to repeat what has already been said, but it just has an unbelievable balance and a je ne sais quoi that is extremely satisfying to enjoy. A beer that elevates the experience from a tasty beverage to something to transform the simple act of drinking into something more thought provoking. Also, for me it is much more balanced than Focal, which some prefer. Cheers."
82,Heady Topper,4.52,"Poured from a 16 ounce can dated 7-31-23 into a teku glass.

Look- Medium gold, very hazy, frothy white head, above average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Pine resin, clementine, nectarine, dank, earthy, medium strength of scent.

Taste- Pine resin, clementine, pithy, pineapple, herbaceous, high strength of flavor.

Feel- Between medium and full body, average carbonation, highly creamy, moderately bitter, mildly mouth warming, mildly dry finish.

Overall- Medium gold and very hazy with above average head retention and lacing. Bouquet was medium strength with notes of pine resin, clementine, nectarine and dankness. Flavor was a great mix of pine resin, clementine, pith and pineapple. Feel was between medium and full body, mildly mouth warming and highly creamy. Overall this beer provided a great drinking experience and was much more of a mix between a West Coast IPA and NEIPA, than a true NEIPA from todays standards."

91,Heady Topper,5.0,
92,Heady Topper,4.5,Yeah ok it’s very good. Great hop flavor. Price point is a bit much but def worth the investment now and again. So seek it out if you can find it and enjoy!

95,Heady Topper,5.0,
96,Heady Topper,4.37,"I had a chance to visit the brewery and have Heady Topper on tap, and bring a few home for a more in depth tasting.

Aside from knowing its fame, I knew little else. My first thoughts were it was not quite as hazy as I expected. Secondly, upon tasting I was surprised to find it reminded me more of a western IPA than an NEIPA. Not that its a bad thing, I'm just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you cannot see into. Most of my experience is with NY based NEIPAs which do seem a bit different than Vermont.

Smell - It seemed more floral than fruity. The alcohol content also shone through a bit.

Taste - Wow. No IBU rating on can but this has to be 60+ but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste. The flavor really helps balance the bitterness. The pine and resin was strong, albeit weaker than some great west coast IPA's I have had. This was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify. No massive grapefruit or citrus flavor I could identify, maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt description.

The aftertaste was ... dark, damp, and lasting. In a great way. To me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer. The stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was ... dark, but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked by.

And I must say I loved the brewery. Beautiful and great staff. I literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it. My only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area, the food options were not strong and it closes at 6PM. Another downside (lol) was the number of very good breweries within 15 minutes, I only was able to make one trip here due to committing to other breweries and the early closing hour."
97,Heady Topper,4.54,"What? I never rated Heady Topper! Great 'tude. Greater Vt. 
My sister brings this to me from Vt. 
a) Hazed golden standard with lace and last - tho brewer encourages us to drink from can, which in a taste test turns out to be great advice. 
s) Baked good floating an herbal, piney, floral sea. 
t) Follows aroma through the full see saw of sweet and bitter, woody, earthy, piney, dank, floral. 
f) Smooth, tongue kissy.
o) Deserves it's pinnacle marks."
98,Heady Topper,4.84,
99,Heady Topper,4.8,The original! Beer is incredibly hoppy and flavorful strong dank tones. This beer is good.
100,Sculpin,4.42,"This beer, and Bell’s Two Hearted Ale, are the best two widely distributed old school IPAs in America. This one leans bitter and the other leans sweet. Both are exceptional and difficult to surpass. Cheers!"
101,Sculpin,5.17,
102,Sculpin,4.57,"It’s my favorite among American IPAs. Has slightly sour taste but comes across as very fruity. Unfortunately, this beer (and the grapefruit version, which is perhaps the even more gifted sibling) is hardly ever available around where I live."
103,Sculpin,5.0,This is a ridiculously good beer. Unfortunately we can't seem to get it any more here in Texas. Bottles are always better than cans.
104,Sculpin,4.43,
105,Sculpin,3.4,"Pour clear and golden, but the head doesn't last long.
Aromas of apples and light flowery, with medum strength.
Taste is juicy enough, but I'm getting a bit of harshness, like carbonation. I don't get the high ratings of this one?
Not very thick in the mouth. Feels like carbonation when you leave on your tongue.

Overall - i will not buy this one again. Just not that impressed."
106,Sculpin,4.57,"This is the best West Coast American IPA I have ever had. The hops taste crisp and go great with food - particularly crabs, fried seafood, and steak. Truly a world class beer!"
107,Sculpin,4.74,
108,Sculpin,4.61,One of my favorites!
109,Sculpin,4.23,
110,Sculpin,3.78,"12oz can PKG 031323 (2 months ago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 7% ABV. The beer pours bright light amber with light khaki head. The head recedes to an irregular ring and rocky cap. Slight lacing. The aroma is mild with light citrus, pine and caramel. The taste is bittersweet piney, citrus with relatively weak caramel malt. Strong bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with average carbonation and mostly dry finish. Overall, good, but not the world class IPA it once was..."
111,Sculpin,4.64,
112,Sculpin,4.15,"Great San Diego IPA. Lovely goldenrod color, big bouquet aroma, big head that lasts most of the way through the glass. It's lovely.
Plenty of apricot, lemon, and maybe cantaloupe aromas, big piney-lemony-tropical hop flavor, nice viscous body. This is a winner.
Cans were on sale -- I never pay full price for Sculpin. It's great for them that they have pricing power and can extract a $2, 3, or even $5 price premium per 6-pack, but there are probably ten other IPAs I enjoy as much or more, and they're cheaper. If I can get in for $12/6, Sculpin is a solid choice. That's not very frequent, which, again, is good for Ballast Point Brewing."

117,Sculpin,4.43,Classic west coast IPA honestly prefer this one over the iconic Stone IPA give both a try and see which one you like the most
118,Sculpin,4.08,"Smells great with an exquisite finish. with a citrus like smell. Hops pull through and is strong and lasts until aftertaste. Solid beer, but prefer the visuals and smell over the taste."
119,Sculpin,4.58,
120,KBS,4.77,"Looks: Beautiful, tan, creamy head over dark brown beer.
Smell: Coffee, bourbon, alcohol, just a little subdued
Taste: This is not subtle. Sweet without being sugary. Bourbon, coffee, chocolate and some alcohol. More balanced than something like Dragon’s Milk that is a little too sugary.
Feel: Thick and just a little effervescent.
Overall: Yum. My favorite stout, I think."

124,KBS,4.22,"Not much left to say. The barrel flavors are there, and they’re not vaguely barrel-like. Oh, and it’s not a sugar bomb. The feel is what stands out the most. Creamy full, and slightly alcoholic at the end. Fantastic."
125,KBS,4.88,"This is one of my favorite beers I have ever had. It has become my standard to compare other stouts, but nothing has compared to Founders so far. My only complaint is that there seems to be slight differences in taste and feel from batch to batch. However, there is a good chance that it's just a misperception on my part. I have always enjoyed every single one. This one is pretty pricey, but it's worth it 100%."
126,KBS,4.79,
127,KBS,4.98,"Really good stout, rivals Dragons Milk which is my favorite readily available stout. Dragons milk has a little bit of a sweet note that I don’t love, and I didn’t detect that with KBS. I do think KBS has a stronger alcohol taste, but I only noticed it on the first couple drinks. Very easy to drink beer, for being 12 ABV."

Dark chocolate and coffee fun welcome."
129,KBS,5.0,
130,KBS,4.36,
131,KBS,3.84,"KBS always pours great, deep dark black and smells really great if you like bourbon. The mouth feel is a medium body with that bourbon smell turning into a subtle taste. Becomes more dark chocolate bitter forward as you drink it. The fresher the beer the more bite the bourbon taste has."

Poured at fridge temp into a tulip glass.

Pours jet-motor-oil-black with a rich and creamy 1.5 finger mocha colored head. 4.25

Sweet and boozy bourbon vanilla and notes coming off the bottle, pour in the glass gives the same. Coffee peeks out as well, though lightly as it warms up. Bumping this up two notches because it gets richer and sweeter as it warms up. 4.75

Bourbon and boozy forward, fairly bitter coffee followed by some earthy chocolate and touch of hops. 4.25

Very warming- slight boozy burn, silky smooth with some light carbo bite. 4

Overall a nice sipper that makes full and excellent use of the bourbon. Aroma and taste are quite delightful and well crafted. 4.25"
140,Hopslam Ale,5.28,
141,Hopslam Ale,4.48,Excellent DIPA. One of the best. Only drawback is that it has a pretty strong alcoholic aroma and taste which people may not prefer. Really good but just not quite in the same level as a Heady Topper or Pliny the Elder.
142,Hopslam Ale,5.0,"This is the best Imperial IPA. 4.45/5 is too low. Firstly, the smell and taste is exactly what a West Coast Imperial IPA should taste like. The hops are complex and massive, but balanced with the malt and the sweetness. The overall taste is not like a 10% ABV beer, but tastes more like something that is 8%. I would really like to compare it to both Heady Topper and Pliny the Elder, but this is the best beer that Bells Brewery makes."

149,Hopslam Ale,3.5,
150,Hopslam Ale,3.48,"Here's a hot take: I don't think this is a good beer. Perhaps I got a bad batch last time, but it just didn't have the flavor profile I'd expect from a beer that almost cracks the top 250. The honey seemed to reduce the supposed ""Hopslam"" down to more of a ""hop nudge"". This meant any flavor complexity seemed to disappear as well. In this case, I think the high ABV is also detrimental as it tastes very alcoholic, and therefore heavy. Too bad, 'cause it's a heck of a value at Costco."
151,Hopslam Ale,4.28,"In a flight at British Open Pub. Oh my goodness. Complex and over the top in all the tight ways. A strong hops palate but also a strong malt backbone. Kinda boozy, but it's New Year's Eve."
152,Hopslam Ale,4.55,"Poured from 12oz can to a tulip glass. Look is fairly clear burnt orange/amber color with a foamy ivory head that takes a while to fall to a nice cap. Sits pretty still in the glass. Smell is pine, melon, caramel apple. Aroma is present but not powerful. Taste is pretty sweet up front with a hit of cantaloupe and citrus. Middle gets a shot of bitterness, but nothing too bracing. Middle sees more fruit flavor like apple and citrus. A bit of pine hits in the finish but it's balanced by a floral, honey sweetness. Balance is a key characteristic here. Aftertaste is apples, caramel and honey. Feel is medium bodied and smooth, smooth, smooth. A low carbonation pops up, but boy this is easy to drink. Overall, I should have tried this years ago, but balked at the price. This is tasty, balanced pretty well between hop bitterness and malt sweetness. Way too easy to drink given the 10% abv. I am a fan of this one though."

161,Bourbon County Brand Stout,5.0,"Goose Island Bourbon County imperial stout. 

Now I must say, this is quite quite good. Like very good. Somewhere between a good stout and an aged whiskey, which isn't a surprise based on the drink itself. That being said, it does not exemplify the thing I like most about beer so far being, drinkability. I do like the refreshing nature of a beer quite a bit and that is the only thing I'd say is absent here. 

At 14.3 percent, it's quite high for a beer, and you feel a lingering alcohol taste towards the end. It is accompanied by some sweet notes like date and chocolate though. 

Mouthfeel is very unique in that somehow the bubbles feel thick. Like the consistency is buttery and but the bubbles feel heavy for some reason bringing out a very odd and unique, but not off putting, almost soupy texture. Mouthfeel end notes are sticky and also a little velvety or caramel-like. 

Smell is a little sour and very malt forward, slightly fruity and even slightly-er herby. 

If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend. I've been sipping as I write this and am appreciating it more and more. One hell of a beer. If you do grab one, the only thing I can say is that it's not smashable, but should be enjoyed slowly."

165,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.86,"Finally getting to try this. 2022 vintage, poured from bottle into a snifter.

Look: Black-brown-red, thick, oily. Very thin light brown head, no retention except a tiny ring. 

Smell: Oh wow. Damn, this is pulling no punches. Chocolate, coffee, caramel, malt, bourbon, dark bread, and the tiniest hints of vanilla beans, raisins, and bananas. Incredibly complex.

Taste: YUUUUUP. Heavyweight, but incredibly smooth at the same time. Lots of the chocolate, with the vanilla bean and caramel notes playing second and third fiddle. Heavy maltiness and bourbon character, but still incredibly smooth with very little burn for the ABV. Raisin note is slightly present in the back, as well as the faintest banana peeking through once the malt onslaught begins to fade.

Feel: Thick but only slightly oily on the palette, light but lingering carbonation. Sticks around a bit, but in a pleasant way and doesn't overstay its welcome. Very slightly syrupy. Really pleasant.

Overall: Masterclass of an imperial stout. Has more distinct flavour impressions than most stouts with adjuncts, but is still perfectly balanced. Deserves the hype."
166,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.93,
167,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.45,"Opened the 2019 bottle that has been aging in my cellar. Poured into a tulip glass. The chocolate colored head quickly dissipated. Midnight color, smell was extraordinary complex consisting of a beautiful bouquet of chocolate, alcohol, fine whiskey, and espresso. Taste was exceedingly complex. The stout lingered on my palate forever, it seemed. Take your time to sip this beauty as it has a high alcohol content. Overall, a warm stout to enjoy in the midst of a winter storm, near a fireplace. Well done."

A- Pours a beautiful black oily color, perfectly opaque. Hardly any head

S-Wow. Rich chocolate, plums, oak,espresso, a bit of whiskey. Probably the best smelling beer I’ve had the pleasure of smelling. 

T-Chocolate, bourbon, oaky goodness, raisins, coffee. Can’t believe this is 14.5 percent ABV. 

M- Rich and oily

O- It’s incredible. It lives up to the hype."
171,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.91,"Pours a deep brown, nearly black.

The smell is very reminiscent of whiskey due to the barrel aging. Slight alcohol tinge, but very fruity and sweet smelling. The smell is like raisins or figs. There is a slight fermentation flavor that reminds me of wine, likely due to the high ABV.

The flavor is very sweet and low in bitterness. The flavor is extremely malty, and fruity. The taste seems like a cross between a high malt beer, a wine, and a bourbon. Notes of figs, raisins, trailed by syruppy molasses and fermentation flavors.

The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy.

A very excellent beer"

177,Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.83,"Look: Pours obsidian black with a very light, copper-colored head.

Smell: Strong whiskey and vanilla aromas, along with fudge and coffee.

Taste: Silky smooth bourbon and vanilla taste, I’m also getting the hints of chocolate and coffee, and there is also some caramel going on as well. The oak is present as it goes down and just finished the taste perfectly.

Feel: Man this is too smooth for how heavy it is. The feel is heavy but this is easily drinkable and just paints the palette with a velvety finish.

Overall: Absolute dynamite for the style, this is one of the best out there and lives up to the hype."

L - Pitch black, with a one-finger tan head. Head goes away after a few minutes or so. Fantastic lacing.
S - French-roast coffee, with chicory. Heavy notes of bourbon, oak, and dark chocolate. Hint of black Cavendish pipe tobacco.
T - Follows nose. Rich burnt sugar. Halfway through the glass, this brew evolves into a something else! Notes of vanilla, cacao, french-roast coffee, and chewy caramel. Hinting at fig, cherry, and raisin. Finish is long-acquired; leaning sweet, with a velvety oaken tobacco.
F - Full-bodied, with little carbonation. Viscous, but not syrupy. Velvety. Dense. Strong. This one is a sipper for sure, and it'll warm you up!
O - Another fantastic brew from Goose Island. While I wouldn't say it's worth the price in the slightest, it is a must-try. Funny enough, the ABV isn't detectable; I didn't realize how strong it was until I peeked at the label halfway through the glass! A delightful & decadent end to a chilly evening. Highly recommend, but I probably won't get it again."

Nose is rich in roasted aromas, dark chocolate that carries some fudge aspects, espresso, strong hop presence as well; adds to the perception of incoming bitter flavors.

Taste mostly mirrors the nose, this beer is dark chocolate and espresso but it carries a chocolate richness to it as well; the finish is very hoppy, pine and rind like in nature.

High end of medium for body; it has a luscious creamy feel to it, super smooth on the palette and a big kick of bitter american hops on the finish...the roast also adds a substantial bitterness as well.

I don't really drink stouts but I do drink this beer because it is perfectly balanced and just overall amazing to sip on."
200,Pale Ale,3.57,"12 oz can acclimated to 49°F and poured into a nonic pint.

Pours a nice clear copper with a 2.5-3 finger seafoamy, barely off white head, leaving little leaving.

Initial aroma is caramel malt, a little pine, and really nothing else. After agitating I kind of just get a general grainy smell. Smells good, just simple.

Initial taste before swallowing is very sweet, with a cereal grain undertone, and a dry hop presence. After swallowing I get more of all of the previous, with the hops being bitter and dry, and seemingly growing in bitterness as I enter the aftertaste, it's not terribly bitter, but the intensity is high.

Mouthfeel is smooth, and goes down easily. The carbonation fades somewhat quickly but can be conjured for a short duration through agitation, it lends a pleasant creaminess through its small bubbles.

Overall it's solid, just simple. Limited flavor notes, in addition to a smooth mouthfeel, but a relatively strong bitterness make for an ale that's easy but not too fast to drink. Would make for a good beer for when you want to not think, or when you want to think. Want to turn your brain off? Drink something simple. Want to think about something? Drink something that doesn't require much thought.

May buy again, not something I would go out of my way for, though. If it's cheap I'll consider it."

213,Pale Ale,4.02,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.

Appearance: Orange-ish golden in color; large creamy barely-off-white head that lingered long, leaving abundant lacing.

Nose: Pine, with a slight hint of floral.

Mouthfeel: Light-medium.

Attack: Lightly-toasted malt, grassy citrus; the tiniest bit of caramel provides depth.

Finish: The hop bitterness comes through strong, but not too aggressively.

Overall: I must admit to approaching this beer with more than a bit of reverence, honoring its status as a long-standing statesman among craft beers. I’m not a hophead, so neither pale ales nor IPA’s are my “go-to’s.” This beer, however, is worthy of its status, and is an ale I’d be proud to serve and drink with food pairings that scream out “pale ale!”"

Feel- Medium body, average carbonation, moderately bitter, highly creamy.

Overall- Pale amber and mildly hazy with average head retention and lacing. Bouquet was malt forward with notes of pine and grapefruit. The flavor followed the nose well and was medium in strength.

218,Pale Ale,4.4,"Finally leaving this one a review after all these years...

Pours pale with some hints of orange, slightly off white head, OK retention but always great lacing when poured semi aggressively.

Nose is an aromatic combination of light floral with some pine mixed in, the malt is nicely present; very very lightly toasted in nature.

Taste is nicely hoppy and balanced; a very nice malt ever so lightly toasty backbone that carries all the pine and grass from the hops.

Light to medium body; very pleasing carbonation, it has a softness too it; finishes with a dry and piney bitter and grassy bite.

The balance of this beer is always impressive to me, it has a unique malt presence and pairs so nicely with the hops."

225,60 Minute IPA,5.0,
226,60 Minute IPA,4.0,I tried this beer a very long time ago as well as the 90 minute imperial IPA. For some reason the brewmaster at Dogfish Head thinks their IPA's need to be more and more malty. The 90 minute used to taste hoppy and now it tastes completely malty and toasted. Now the 60 minute version is ruined. Can't figure out why these beers started out very hoppy but are now malt dominant. The brewmaster is an idiot in my opinion. These beers aren't horrible but they are not at all what they once we're. The BM can go screw himself in my opinion. He must not like hops or something stupid like that. Screw him!

241,Stone IPA,4.18,"This classic American IPA starts with bready malt and a restrained note of stone fruit, then finishes with decisive bitterness. An ultra classic rarely improved upon.

There's a bit of a sweet malt backbone to the beer that wasn't obvious to me in the nose. It seems a bit more than I recall from having this over the years, but the can has a date that puts it at a month old, so it's not that. The citrus note melds into the malt, weakening its pop compared to the nose. Pine comes through with a little more power to make up for that, although it isn't as fresh - more like the pine needles have fallen to the forest floor. Still a solid IPA, but it isn't as brash as I thought it once was."

Mouth feel is medium bodied that is crisp, and dry with a bitter finish.

Zombie Dust is a well-made American Pale Ale that is a little too hoppy for this non hophead."

Translucent, pastel gold. Proffers up two fingers of finely minced froth that’s white as an untouched snowcap. Modest retention gives way to sudsy, webbed lacing.

Bouquet:
A mango, pineapple, peach smoothie rife with tangy Citra and bright, tangerine-sweet Amarillo, woven together with slender strands of earthy Mosaic.

Feel:
Full-bodied and thick with hop oils, the texture is given a much needed third dimension by a boisterous, peach fuzz carbonation.

Taste:
A huge chomp of just-ripe, yellow mango topped with shreds of candied orange peel. Then, lemony Citra and the tropic sweetness of Amarillo rise like flowers from the distinct, new earth flavor of Mosaic hops. Concludes on a long, low, afterburn of hop bitters and sauvignon blanc."

320,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.65,"Pours a nice dark amber red with a ""bone"" colored head. Smells of malt, tastes very malty, a muted bitterness at the start with an powerful rosin taste and dry feel, the bitterness begins to bite after the fact. No alcohol hidden here. Nice for what it is."
321,Arrogant Bastard Ale,2.56,"I mistakenly pick this Ale up from a Pick- Six and realized that it wasn’t a IPA which I am use to drinking. Needless to say, not impressed at all, the ale is overpowering with alcohol."
322,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.98,
323,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.55,"Look: Pours a deep shade of amber with a generous, three finger head of beige foam that has excellent retention and laces the glass very well. No visible carbonation.

Aroma: Sticky toffee and caramel, bitter grapefruit peel, spruce needles and toasted orange peel. A touch of sweet/funky guava.

Taste: Upfront, treacle and sweet tamarind. Quickly transitions into moderately bitter notes of flambéed orange and grapefruit peel. Ends on rich notes of bitter tree resin and spicy spruce needles.

Feel: Full bodied and velvety. Very low carbonation. Silky smooth and creamy. Alcoholic heat profile is very mild, but somewhat detectable, I wouldn't call it boozy but you can definitely tell it's not a light weight beer.

Overall: I've had this beer many, many times but haven't had it in a while. It's much better than I remember. Would highly recommend to anyone who likes their west coast IPAs and hasn't tried it yet, or any veterans who may have not had it in a long time. Definitely a world class imperial IPA / ""strong ale""."
324,Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.72,"Poured in standard pint glass. Nice ample, fine sustained head. Very bitter, slightly boozy when straight from the fridge. Did not enjoy, had to walk away. Allowed to warm slightly but still cool, had a more pleasurable experience. Prominent bitterness was accompanied by greater complexity of flavors including leather, wet tobacco, faint hint of dried fig. Well-suited for a cool Spring day post-yard work. 

A beer I would prefer not to eat a meal with, but rather enjoy on its own when in the mood for something strong and different. Never got to enjoy the barrel version. With its name; likely a victim of its own success, but as with a once fantastic bottle-conditioned bicycle beer, it happens. At least this beer still retains its general character and is not simply concerned with appeasing the easy-drinking masses. Still memorable for a first-timer. Not a go-to by any means, but will not hesitate to drink again on occasion."

335,Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.25,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Appearance is a mahogany color with a thick foamy beige head. Good retention and lacing.

Aroma: dark fruit, caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, roasted nuts.

Taste: just like the aroma and very crisp and bitter, which is a nice change from the typical lower IBU beers that I've had. Other notes of grapefruit, toffee, and maybe even coffee. Body is medium-light."

Smells pretty much exclusively of pine. Some light notes of dirt and grass.

Taste follows. Pine. Pine. Pine. Bitter pine.

Sticky mouthfeel with a strong, long lasting, bitter aftertaste. Medium carbonation.

369,Celebration,3.74,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a tulip glass.

Look- Deep amber, very hazy, plentiful visible particulate, medium tan frothy head, above average head retention, average lacing.

Smell- Biscuit, pine, faint grapefruit, medium strength of scent.

Taste- Biscuit, pine, grapefruit, medium strength of flavor.

Feel- Between medium and full body, highly creamy, moderately astringent, high bitterness, average carbonation.

Overall- Look was deep amber with a high amount of haziness and well above average head retention. Bouquet was predominantly biscuit with some pine and citrus. Taste was also dominated by malt with understated pine and grapefruit. Feel was highly creamy with between medium and full body, but moderate astringency. Overall this West Coast IPA was much too malt forward for my liking and with an ABV of just 6.8% it was unnecessary."

A: 3.75 - Poured from 12oz can into shaker pint. Poured clear with dregs at the end giving a slight haze. amber brown with tannish, cream colored cap of foam. Head filled the top of the glass. Very nice lacing sticking to the glass throughout the session.

S: 4 - grapefruit, citrus, and pine. Sweetness from the crystal malts is present with a caramel aroma. Slight toffee to the smell, too.

T: 4.5 - Begins with an interplay of a candy like sweetness with herbal-orange flavor that rounds itself out with bitterness from the hop resins. mineral quality on the back end that is refreshing and announces the bitterness. Finish is not overly dry. Bitterness lingers - the “stickiness” from the hops is pleasant and never overwhelming.

F: 4 - medium to full bodied. Carbonation was soft and pleasant.

O: 4.5 - in my mind, this is THE example of how crystal malts in an IPA can serve to produce a drink that is balanced with the bitterness and flavor of hops. Crazy to call an IPA balanced - but Sierra Nevada knows a thing or two on this. The fresh hop flavor of the classic Centennial and Cascade varieties in this beer is unmatched."

16oz can (date code A2623, so packaged 1/26/2023) into a Hennepin glass. Pours a beautiful glowing deep golden color with a nice fluffy bright white head. 

Aroma is funky and bready, grassy. Yeasty esters, clove, spice. Overripe fruit. Banana bread. 

Taste is sweet, fruity, funky. More bready yeast (or yeasty bread), malty sugars, spice. Old World hops. Some residual grain. A vaguely bitter, clean finish. 

Mouthfeel is soft, smooth, full bodied. Reference-level carbonation. Exemplary for the style. 

Overall this is still one of my favorite Belgian tripels—La Fin Du Monde never disappoints.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5
12oz bottle, best before 7/9/12, poured into a tulip.

Golden yellow beer w/ a huge bright white head that defies gravity, leaves behind a beautiful film of lace.

Nose is all Belgian yeast, clean pale malt, and slight alcohol. 

Taste is just so smooth. Pale malt, sweet candi sugar, overripe banana, and a slight warming from the alcohol.

Mouthfeel is luxurious, so seductively smooth and drinkable.

Overall, an outstanding version of the style. This beer would be a perfect pairing with so many foods, strong enough to stand up to anything but never dominant. Just a world-class beer that I think anyone would enjoy."

Smell is spicy and fruity. A good dose of clove and malt. Taste is sweet up front with a blast of clove, honey, and malt. Middle of the sip gets briefly bitter, then hits with some candy apple sweet/tart flavors. Finish is alcohol, more spice and a bit of malt. Feel is medium bodied with soft, plentiful carbonation. That creamy head never goes away and allows for a nice soft mouthfeel. Overall, I am enjoying this beer. I'll be working my way through the sample 6er. This is a nice drinker that I'd have again.

Magnificent looking beer. Dark brown body with a massive off white head. This is replenished by swarms of carbonation up the side of the tulip, leaving gobs of lacing.

Malty aroma with a lingering sweetness. Also, a faint funkiness.

On tasting, well, so smooth. Abv well hidden. Tons of dark fruit, light sweetness. Takes some restraint not to gulp it down.

Mouth full, finish is where the abv makes an appearance, mixed with plum and raisin notes.

440,Ten FIDY,4.41,"A black body covered with a two-finger brown
head assimilates into a pint glass. The head is quite active, and fades in a few minutes, but leaves ample lacing... the carbonation level is good. The smell is absurdly light for a 10.5 ABV Imperial stout. Mostly malt and grain, with a subtle sweetness on the back end. The flavor, however is superb. Coffee and chocolate notes, malt, grains, nuttiness, subdued hops for the style... this beer is finely crafted, and literally wafts across the tongue like waves on the beach, especially as it warms during the session. The high ABV stout category has been somewhat overrun by a faddish movement toward barrel aged brews, and many of them are great beers... but Oscar Blues Ten Fidy is a great example of how good a finely designed Imperial Stout can be in the hands of a great brewer. I love this beer!"

444,Ten FIDY,4.59,"Poured black, really black. With a brown head that stood tall. 
The aroma, while not as strong as it would be for most as my nose has been affected by Covid, is still coffee and roasted malts.
The taste is an amazing balance of flavors; the roasted malts bring the coffee and cacao and dark fruits and the hops provide an edge that keeps the flavor in check. 
The feel is almost chewy, and it seems right for all the flavors that are present.
This is one of my favorite “pure” imperial stouts, just so good."

448,Ten FIDY,4.33,"Pours a jet black that forms a moderate caramel head. Dissipates at a slower pace and leaves a good amount of soapy lacing and a nice level of retention on the top. Aromas of licorice, cherries, roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. Taste is heavy on the roasted malts, bitter chocolate, coffee, and earthy hops.

Pours a pitch black, abyss black. A dense but quicky fading beige head on the initial pour. Leaves sticky lacing on the glass after each sip.

Aromas of roasty malts and chocolate. Very inviting.

A delicous imperial stout. Great tastes of chocolate, deep roasted malts and a definite boozy aftertaste. Very drinkable even at a 10.5% ABV.

Very smooth consistency with low to moderate carbonation. Leaves a nice coating in your mouth after each sip.

Overall a top-notch stout. Highly recommended...cheers!"

454,Ten FIDY,4.02,"Pours black with a fluffy, sculpted three finger head that lasts and coats the glass with foam. Aroma is roasted black malt. There is a resemblance of coffee as well. Taste is roasted malt, with a touch of sweetness, as if it were similar to a milk stout. However, the black malt is the over-arching profile here. Along with it comes a feeling of bubbles on the tongue at the end of the profile."

Canned On Date: 26 Nov, 2018
Consumed on: 25 Dec, 2022
Glass: Tulip Snifter
ABV: 10.5%
Serving Temp: room temp


Look: 
Black with a 2-finger high brown head. The head dissipates to a thick ring and cover. Lacing is very good.

Smell: 
Deep and dark roasted malts. Bittersweet chocolate and some faint coffee. Light licorice/anise and a hint of molasses. Earthy and somewhat spicy hops.

Taste: 
An earthy hop bitterness starts things off but is quickly met and balanced by the substantial roasted dark malt notes. Coffee and chocolate (first bittersweet but quickly changing to semisweet) are noticeable. A mild sweetness appears that is a combo of semisweet chocolate, molasses, and faint dark fruits. A quick hit of earth comes back and lingers in through the finish. The sip finishes a shade dry.

Feel: 
Creamy, velvety and viscous. There is a nice warmth from the alcohol. The body is between medium and medium-full (though closer to medium)

Overall: 
A very nice imperial stout that makes a great winter warmer and fireplace sipper. Nice balance and even complexity.

The 4 years of age have had a wonderful effect on this brew. If I recall it when fresh (it has been a couple of years), it was quite bitter and even one note (maybe two notes). Now it is superb. I wonder how it would be at 5 years?

I also wonder if the IBUs have been reduced in more recent versions. I recall either 75 or 95 IBUs for Ten-Fidy, and as I mentioned the brew seemed very bitter to me when fresh a few years ago. OB currently lists the IBUs as 65."

Big tight brown head forms over the dense dark elixir.
Smell is stone fruit, cacao, anise, coffee, dark roast malt.
Taste is the same as the nose, but somehow it seems the flavor profile changed from previous cannings. It’s lacking ‘ fullness’ and anticipated bitterness. 
Feel for this batch is less oily and thinner, uptight carbonation.
Overall, an American Stout classic that’s always a treat."

460,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.79,"This is probably the first beer I'm reviewing that you could consider a holy elixir, as Abbaye de Brogne is a brewery located in an abbey in Belgium since St. Peter appeared to Gérard de Brogne, a nobleman who lived around 20 km or so away from the abbey, and instructed the knight to build an abbey to honor God.

That story, allegedly, took place somewhere around 880 AD, making this a very old abbey indeed.

But in 2013, Belgian brewmaster Bruno Deghorain, along with his business partner, Gaby Smet conceived a plan to set up a small brewery in the abbey, with the intent to make abbey style Belgian ales like they did in the days of yore.

This beer, Trappistes Rochefort 10, is part of that dream.

Is it any good? Is this a holy beer?

Let's find out!

CLASSIFICATION:

It's an ale, and when it comes to Belgian beers, there's a few styles.

Here we're enjoying a Belgian Quad, which are rich, strong ales with bold flavors. Typically, they're quite dark in color, hovering around deep ruby reds and browns with garnet hues.

In terms of taste, they're very sweet on the palate, low bitterness, but packing an ABV that will getcha there.

When it comes to beer, Belgian Quads are some of my favorite beers next to stouts.

COLOR:

Caramel, a deep caramel almost as if you left it on the burner a bit too long and it got dark brown. Nice hefty butterscotch colored head that lingers for a long time.

AROMA:

Very malty on the nose, which is the dominant smell that I'm getting. A little bit in the background is a faint hint of milk chocolate. Little bit of caramel and brown sugar.

BODY & PALATE:

Malt and caramel on the palate. There's a faint spritz of clove that I taste. Little bit of a fruity taste that comes in, almost like wine in a sense. I do want to stress it's quite mild in that fruity taste, which I guess is that faint hint of citrus that I'm attributing to these particular kind of hops that they use.

In terms of mouthfeel, it's pretty dense, almost like Coca-Cola in that sense. Very smooth, even for the ABV of 11.6% and fizziness of the beer.

FINISH:

It ends on a Belgian, malty dark chocolate sorta finish. This beer lives and dies by its malt character.

CONCLUSION:

This is a heavy beer that's akin to snuggling up in your favorite blanket and bunny slippers and sitting by the fire. It lives and dies by its rich malty flavor that hangs around.

I definitely do not recommend this beer for a refreshing drink. This is more of an experience, a beer you savor.

As far as holy, well, I'll leave that judgment to those more suited to make that call, as I'm not particularly religious.

But, I bet if Jesus had a signature beer, I bet this would be his beer of choice.

As far as myself, this has shot up to one of my favorite beers of all time, and this brewery became one of my favorite breweries of all time. They're a gem. Only issue though is availability and price. If you can find it, they are pricey, so if you're after a nice beer on a budget, might want to look elsewhere.

But, you definitely get what you pay for, this beer is wonderful!

Until next time...

Cheers!"

466,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.24,"Pours a translucent rich brown with a fizzy, cola head that settles to a thick 0.5"" coaster with very good retention and lacing. Nose is baked brown bread, prune, raisin, date, baking spice, hop spice, light alcohol, cinnamon, fruit cake. Taste has moderate, booze-soaked fruit sweetness, treacle, spiced red wine. Spiced hop on the finish, with a lingering sweet booziness. Mouthfeel has moderate weight and light, fizzy carbonation. Far more mild than Westy 12 in terms of its fruity booziness, with much more spice and hop character."
467,Trappistes Rochefort 10,3.18,"Apparently this is one of the best beers in the world...so reviewing again. Many think that it is better than Westerveleren 12. 

Aroma is nothing special, similar to a canned Pelforth Brune. Lots of large bubbles, not as beautiful as Westerverelen or a Guinness. And definitely not a Chouffee IPA or Duvel Tripel Hop. But as the froth reduces, it improves.

The best thing about this beer is the hop aftertaste. It's one of the best mouthfeels of any beer. Really amazing. But it doesn't compare with a Chouffe IPA in terms of flavour for me."

471,Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.38,"Allowed to acclimate to 50°F (a little too cold, but I let it warm more) and poured into a Chimay goblet.

Pours a hazy carob brown with lighter sediment floating around and a tan quickly dissipating tan head (forgot to pay attention to how tall).

Initial aroma is a slight smell of high alcohol, with a hefty dose of yeast and malt, slight notes of milk/semisweet chocolate wafted around before I smelled it directly. Returning for a second round of smelling I notice a slight note of grass. A third round reminding me of a general whiskey smell.

Initial taste is again, alcohol, followed by malt, followed by milk/semisweet chocolate, followed by light alcohol burn all over the tongue but concentrated in the middle. Third and fourth sips yield raisin and/or generic dark dried fruit notes upfront, as well as revealing a sweetness, similar to the natural sweetness of dried fruit. Sipping after that uncovered a spiciness that comes before the sweetness, combined with the warmth from the alcohol it feels very sensible. I have to admit that for me personally it becomes harder to drink as it warms more because I have a hard time with spirits, and the alcohol in this one is not hidden, but it's still got fantastic flavor.

Mouthfeel is smooth, although a little thin, and the carbonation disappears.

It tastes like a fireplace, super cozy and tastes like home kind of beer. This is the perfect beer to drink while wearing a cotton sweater by a fireplace or a library or den.

It's expensive but it can be justified because it's excellent and has a high ABV. Will absolutely be purchasing again, as well as recommending and purchasing the others in the line."

485,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.3,"Well, they basically watered down the old Boston Lager, which didn't need any ""remastering"" in the first place. It tastes like the old version except less of everything: not as malty, not as hoppy, less of a cinnamon note.... Just less. I rate it compared to the old version so it's rated a lot less. They are obviously dumbing it down for the light beer drinker, which is a pathetic thing to do."
486,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.69,"Sam Adams Boston Lager, new version, draft at a restaurant dinner in August, 2023. Overall a good beer with dinner. This is the newer version of Sam Adams. It has a good head and lacing; the body is a healthy amber. Flavor has a hint of roasted malt. The aftertaste has a minor pleasant bitterness. I can't directly compare to the ""old"" Sam. From memory, the new one is more to my taste, with a smoother flavor."
487,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.69,"This is the remastered version. Drinking on the national day of Massachusetts in my home state of Massachusetts.

12 oz can acclimated to 46°F and poured into a pilsner glass.

Pours a somewhat hazy, medium amber color, with a 2.5 finger, long lasting, foamy white head, leaving medium lacing.

Initial aroma is heavy on malt and yeast, some spicy phenols coming out. After agitating, the year dominates the foreground, with maybe a slightly caramely quality found hiding behind?

Initial taste before swallowing is a little bland, yeasty with a definite dry floral spice. After swallowing I'm met with a mild hop and malt bitterness, slightly soapy and not dry. Malt is not just bitter, presenting caramely and very bready. Some grainy taste to it.

Mouthfeel is frothy, due in what I suspect is in large part due to the satisfying carbonation. Additionally a little choppy or rough, but not at all bad, it's a lager and it feels like one.

Overall it's a solid beer, not trying to be anything it's not. Excellent if you want just a lager

Likely to buy for the national day of Boston and Massachusetts once a year, but not otherwise, I don't remember how much a single was, but I doubt it was cheap enough to make me reconsider. Sorry Sam Adams."
488,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.27,"It's unfortunate that they felt the need to change this beer as I found it nicely refreshing before. Is it more refreshing now? Maybe, but I don't think it tastes as good. There is a lack of the expected caramel notes and it's a bit too high on the hops and carb for me. Still better than aot of macro options though."
489,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.32,"Anytime you set a standard, you are entitled to change that standard. Boston Lager wants to compete in a bigger market and tweaked their formula. That didn’t immediately make it a terrible beer. It’s a little more hoppy, a tad sweeter, a little more approachable.
If my airport restaurant choices are Bud Light or Boston Lager.,. well.,."
490,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,1.72,"Boston Lager was the beer that made me actually appreciate my drink.

I have a question to you is Sean Davies still here and he is still there is he available? That would be great. I’ll take Sean thank you bye-bye show me the other guy is Premium. I really loved SA for many years but moved on to true craft brews. Last week at a family get together they offered SA. I was anxious to taste this again but was shocked at what swill this had become. The beer looked thin, and tasted of cereal grains. Thought I had time traveled back to Michelob days. Really hope they don’t completely destroy Dogfish Head."
496,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.5,"I haven’t had the non nerfed version of Samuel Adam Boston Lager since around 2008. So it’s hard for me to compare the original with the “Cost Cutting” opps I meant “Remastered” version. But it tastes mostly like I remembered, maybe a bit more watery now though. It’s a mighty fine beer that I’ve kind of been craving more of lately. I just wish since it’s now beer flavored seltzer water, that they’d slash the price a tad bit.

497,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.0,"This is like the New Coke or the Star Wars Specialized Edition all over again.
Why in the world would you mess with the original recipe that is the flagship for your brand?
The Remastered Sam Adams is OK, I don't hate it but I definitely preferred the original.
If you want to come out with a new flavor, then come out with a new flavor. Leave the original as is.

With that said, the remastered version is dryer, a bit hoppier, less sweet and less malty. The carbonation is about the same, the mouthfeel is a bit thinner.

I probably won't be buying the new Sam Adams anymore as there are superior options available."
498,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,2.31,"The Remaster should be Demastered. The rich, creamy amber of old has been replaced with a more bitter and dry, lite ESB. I’m halfway through my 1st 12 pack. Wondering if I can make it to the end…..

Nose is orange, grapefruit, and lemon peel; pine and resin; green pepper and some slight astringency. Nose isn't as rich and expressive as, say, Stone IPA, but it still hits the classic West Coast notes (plus a little spice). Taste follows the nose - citrus sweetness (orange, grapefruit) and mild malt and bitterness. Juicy, candied, orange and grapefruit peels dominate. Finish is a little rough around the edges (green pepper). Overall, like the nose, it's most reminiscent of a dialed-down Stone. Mouthfeel is moderate with a touch of softness.

513,IPA,3.75,
514,IPA,4.23,"Can dated 4/12:
Pours a classic medium golden and clear, ignoring the chill that adds condemnation to the glass on a humid day. A classic citrus pith and pine, with a little more of the latter, comes out even on a cold beer. At this initial lower temperature, the grain cones out as lightly toasted bread crust backed by a husky to piney bitterness, evolving more towards the classic hop flavor. The beer finished in a classically WCIPA fashion at this point.

The beer gets a little bit of rye bread crust in the aroma as it warms, but a larger amount of pine relative to the colder version. The pine also starts to take hold of the flavor profile, and I’m starting to lose any citrus vibe in either attribute a quarter glass into the pour.

Feel is medium, leaning light (even a tad more so considering the state of IPAs today). Upon reaching what I would call a proper temp, the aroma gains a slight floral vibe pairing with grapefruit pith more than pine. Interesting how it seems to have evolved for me today. The taste also turns a bit pithy in the middle while continuing to finish a bit piney.

A nice, pretty much classic IPA that seems just slightly less brash than I recall from the era when this was a new thing to me."

518,IPA,2.72,"APRIL 2023.
Industrial (non-craft) beer, produced for my European market by Heineken (NED).
It can be found in 35.5 cl bottles and the price fluctuates between €2.60 and €2.90 in local supermarkets (which in these parts are not a sales channel for craft beers).
Sometimes it is more fragrant and gives a greater sense of freshness, sometimes it seems more stale.
Even the vivacity of carbonation is sometimes more lively than others, but on average it has a sufficient fizz.
Not an irresistible scent on the nose in which herbaceous and malt notes are felt.
Deep golden color, almost orange.
Abundant foam: soft but persistent.
Medium/light body.
Partly malty at the beginning with hints of caramel, then hops take over with a fair amount of bitterness.
Main hints of resin, citrus and herbaceous (pine needles).
Dry, fairly bitter.
Sometimes there is a ferrous note.
One of the least worst industrial beers, the intensity (medium, but perceptible even after drinking) of the final bitterness is the thing that most distinguishes it from the other industrial products available on the shelves.
Drinkable, but soulless."

COLOR: bright amber, quite beautiful in natural sunlight
HEAD: 1 finger of lace with a mix of large and small bubbles which slowly settles into a gentle ring of bubbles along the edges of the glass. I admit this was poured into a Belgian glass. 
AROMA: pine predominant with lesser (but balancing!) notes of malt and, faintly, bread 
TASTE: a dance of piney hop and classic malt, lighter in mouthfeel but well developed in taste with no off-notes.

OVERALL: drinkable and balanced; less heavy (but in the same vein as) than Bell’s Two-Hearted or Cigar City Jai Alai, but heavier and with a better malt backbone than a typical session IPA.

556,Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5.0,"This is my favorite Weiss Bier, the fact that it comes from a brewery that dates back to the 11th century is a nice little bonus. It has the perfect balance of alcohol taste with that of wheat, fresh baked bread and some banana, it’s earthy yet refreshing.

10/10 A must try!"

571,Jai Alai IPA,1.5,
572,Jai Alai IPA,4.46,"So, I was an “early adopter” of IPAs, and have tasted tons of greats, tons of meh, but mostly a lot of unbalanced stuff…

Juicy, NE, West Coast, East Coast, Missoula Citrus Guava Pale over oak, dry-hopped, let’s just shove chia hops in a bottle, and call it done:

This is just nice. Very balanced. Not overly sugary. Alcohol is well-hidden, and I don’t feel like I’m drinking repurposed bong-water.

This is a lovely, well-balanced experience.

P.S. I have lived in FL for three years, and avoided it like the plague, mainly because I just want a decent, refreshing lager."
573,Jai Alai IPA,4.24,This beer is super popular in Florida and kind of put this brewery on the map. It’s smooth and easy to drink. Good beer to snag at any local store in Florida or out of state if you like IPAs.

579,Jai Alai IPA,4.25,"From a 12oz can:

Appearance: Clear yellow-gold, big head.

Smell: Citrusy, pine, citrus rind.

Taste: On the sweet side to start, grapefruit sweetened with a few spoonfuls of table sugar. Citrusy sweetness continues through the body, the finish dries up a little with some orange and a little bitterness.

Overall: Finally got a 6 pack that wasn't old, so I can do a review. On the sweet side for a traditional IPA but less sweet than most of the new hazy/cloudy IPAs. I kind of like my old-school IPAs with a little sweetness, so no problems here. A good drinker, but falls off when it is old."
580,Centennial IPA,3.75,"Pours a reddish copper with a generous off-white head. Fragrance of pine and citrus. Tastes of pine, citrus, and caramel malt. Mildly bitter with a hint of sweetness.

Another fine product from Founders."

584,Centennial IPA,4.15,
585,Centennial IPA,4.75,"Well, I'll be honest, this is my go-to IPA! Hoppy goodness with an outstanding malt-balance. Great amber color. Hoppy, yet sweet aroma. Bitter, yet sweet flavor. It's in my fridge at all times! Bonus alert: I get a 15-pack at the local for $16.99! Cha-ching! There is nothing I don't like about this beer!"
586,Centennial IPA,4.11,"This is my everyday beer. It's the best at its price point, although, to be fair, there aren't many 7% beers under $20 for a fifteen-rack. It has some lovely complex sunny bitterness, with some unfortunate blandness in the aftertaste that would work well for someone new to hops, compared with some other heavy IPAs. Smooth for 7.2%, but it lacks some of the fruity and citric complexity of its baby cousin, the Founders All Day IPA. This is not a special occasion beer. It's just a solid everyday sipper."
587,Centennial IPA,4.53,"Very close to a personal fave IPA standard set by Bell’s Two Hearted. It’s not quite Northern Midwest, but way good, especially at $18.50 a 15-pack… (!)"

594,Centennial IPA,3.88,"Pretty great. Pours clear with a long-lasting frothy head. Aroma is citrusey and a bit less hoppy than other IPAs I've tried. Flavor is clean, citrusey and crisp. While it is of course hoppy it is very well-balanced by the malt giving it a very easy-to-drink character. Honestly need to be a bit careful drinking this given how light it tastes for the alcohol content. Nothing unusual here, just a great example of an IPA. Punches far above its weight for the price (20 bucks for a 15-pack)."

Attack: Very complex, rich malt, dark dried fruit, followed by warming alcohol.

Finish: Just enough bitterness from the roasted malt to balance the attack.

Had with some chorizo sausages (a good meal); 11% so be careful :) Had this another night, and picked up a lot of cherry, maybe some chocolate. Buttery and smooth mouthfeel, pleasantly carbonated. That scotch taste is what does it for me in this beer, need to try more of this style."

Poured a semi-clear copper color into a Samuel Smith Imperial pint glass with visible carbonation and a frothy white head that lingered & left loads of lacing. Earthy pine resinous overtones in aroma with hints of tangerine, peach, apricot, tropical fruits and malty goodness. Flavor follows nose with a nice malty bitter-sweet backbone for a finish. Sits mid to back of palate with slight carbonation tingle on the tongue. A little part it's prime but this is the last one I was saving to see if it changed with age. Remember it pretty much the same; an outstanding offering from Tröegs. World class indeed."

635,Nugget Nectar,5.0,"Outstanding! Highly recommend! Received as a gift, going to get more!"
636,Nugget Nectar,4.26,"Dark copper-amber, but bright and almost translucent, a clear pint glass full of it reveals. There's virtually no head to describe, but that's the Philly style of serving draft beers. Even without a head, it's a lovely beer. Little aroma rises above the glass, a little malt a little hops and no discernable alcohol. This is one of those that doesn't offer much to the nose, but gives the tongue a workout. Quickly, it's learned that regardless of the word ""nectar"" in its name, this isn't some sort of overly sweetened ale. There is some sweetness provided by ample malting, but this one bites. There's just the right dose of alcohol in the mix that it amplifies the sharp hoppiness, which is noteworthy. With notes of pine and citrus, this is a bitterly hopped brew (a good thing) that brings so much more character than most in this style. The glass lacing is a little short. So, this isn't one for the nose and maybe not long for the eyes. It is a complex hopfest within a solid malted body."
637,Nugget Nectar,5.0,"Rare 5 out 5. Looking for balanced And if so high marks it will receive. No hop bomb but you can taste the some of the ""excessively dry hopped,"" But sage quickly to a malt creamy goodness. If you're looking for a hop slinger move on but if you're looking for great tasting grab it whem you can. Cheers!"
638,Nugget Nectar,4.19,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single from a local bottle shop for $4.55. ""Freshest by 04/28/2023""....given that this was released pretty recently (January 10th), I would say that this beer is less than one month old.

Look: Pours a clear medium amber color with a tan-colored head that slowly dissipated to a very thin layer. Looks very nice.

Smell: Very nice aromas of fresh hops - earthy, resinous pine along with some dankness, woody notes, and grapefruit notes. There's a bit of caramel sweetness underneath all of that hop aroma. This beer smells a bit like a slightly stronger version of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale.

Taste: It's surprisingly balanced, refreshing, and drinkable. Up front, it has a very nice maltiness with the caramel notes coming through briefly before being taken over by hops. The finish is actually not nearly as bitter as I was expecting; it's relatively smooth and has a pleasant long-lingering bitterness that is not very intense. Nice grapefruit rind flavors on the finish also.

Feel: The mouthfeel is a bit chewy. Nicely carbonated. Medium plus body.

Overall: This beer brings back memories. The first time I had this beer was in the mid- to late- 2000s in Atlanta. Someone had acquired this beer in a trade (I think) and brought it to a beer share. I was blown away by this beer. There aren't many other Imperial Red Ales out there. One that I used to consume a lot of was Terrapin's Big Hoppy Monster. Fast forward to living in PA: I moved here just over 10 years ago. It was probably 9 years ago when I made a feeble attempt to procure some Nugget Nectar. I called a beer distributor that I passed on my way to work and at that time the state laws only allowed them to sell entire cases. I wasn't able to buy/consume that much beer so I passed. Hard to believe that it's been over 15 years since I have had this beer! Enough with story time. This beer certainly deserves its #1 ranking among Imperial Red Ales.

From the can and website:
Color: Straw/Orange
Hops: Nugget, Warrior, Tomahawk, Simcoe, Palisade
Grain: Munich, Pilsner, Vienna
Yeast: Ale

It's impossible to forget your first squeeze. Once a year, as the newest humulus lupulus harvest arrives at Tröegs, we blend these super-fresh hops into an Imperial Amber Ale. Exclusively dry-hopped, Nugget Nectar is an explosion of pine, resin and mango."

Pours a somewhat cloudy medium amber, with a quarter inch foamy head and some spotty cling. Aromas of caramel, malt, brown sugar, some pine, some raisins, light figs and dates. Pretty similar flavors- caramel, pine, malt, brown sugar, light raisins and dates. Tastes a little bit herbal, with a light hop bitterness and some alcohol warming as it warms. Smooth for the ABV, a very good medium body, appropriately carbonated. 

Wow, this really does age well. Lots of caramel, malt and pine. Need to buy this more often. Really enjoyable."
642,120 Minute IPA,4.81,"This beer is so unique that it’s hard to describe. 
It really is nothing short of incredible and worth every penny of the price I paid for it. If you’re lucky enough to find a four pack of this in the store, don’t even hesitate just buy it."
643,120 Minute IPA,4.13,"5/20/23 Poured from a 12 oz bottle purchased at the Denny House, Waynesburg, PA....Gala night for The Way.

Pours a strange (not bad) deep amber orange color. Very little head or lacing.

Hints of sweetness with the very chewy beer. Pine and pineapple. Smooth, hoppy bite!

Special beer and a fun night!"
644,120 Minute IPA,4.0,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. 2017 vintage, 5 years old. 

A: The most vigorous pour I could muster did not turn up any head. Deep brown in color with good clarity. I half expected sediment, but there really isn't any. Not much in the way of lacing either. A few tiny specs.

S: A lot of raw honey, apricot, malty aromas of fig jam and a pop of berry. Highly estery with pineapple/tropical notes. Orange marmalade complete with peels. Earthy and leafy notes with that aged ""forest floor"" character. Treacle and a hint of toast/crust. 

T: Follows the nose. Lots of raw honey up front, figs and berries, richer malty notes of molasses and toasted crust and scones. Very tropical and estery- big notes of pineapple, starfruit, papaya. Orange marmalade. Hit of warming alcohol. Downright spicy with herbal oiliness. Earthy and leafy. Dose of ""musty book"" and nutty sherry oxidation. Aggressive spicy/oily hop finish with trailing alcohol heat and figgy malt. 

M: very thick with a ton of coating residual sugar. It is syrupy in texture. Good pressing sense of weight. Carbonation is fading, but there's still some fine pricking around the tip of the tongue. Gritty hop astringency. 

O: This beer becomes very interesting with age. It might be an acquired taste for those who prefer IPAs fresh, though. It becomes a three way brawl between a brawny malt character, aggressively estery alcohol, and a good dose of oily/spicy hops. Age has deepened that malt into a lot of fruity complexity, brought out more earthy ""forest floor"" hop notes, and a lot of musty and sherry-like oxidation. It's also hot and a bit much when fresh though. Something like 1-3 years of age may be the sweet spot for me I think, but it comes down to preferences. It certainly isn't bad now."
645,120 Minute IPA,4.0,
646,120 Minute IPA,4.29,"Well, well, 15$ for this one. Had to try it. Nice experience after a hard day of work. But no sir, it ain't for me. 
Tastes like a bitter honey syrup. Low to no carbonation. 
Definitely worth to try. Once!!!"
647,120 Minute IPA,3.99,"Yea, this IPA is an icon. However, not the most drinkable IPA for the masses. Your wife nor girlfriend will like this beer! I have heard the term Robitussin voiced. However, you, as a beer drinker, must try it at least once. I’ve tried it several times.Heavy and alcoholic are the first terms that come to mind. Refreshing, no. Tasty, yes. Everyday, no."
648,120 Minute IPA,4.0,Pours a cloudy copper. Thin foam. Very chunky. Cider aroma. Huge malt and hop flavor simultaneously. Very heavy. Sweet alcohol cider finish. Not really you typical IPA and not something I would drink regularly. Definitely worth a try though.
649,120 Minute IPA,2.9,"the 90min IPA tastes so much better than the 60min that I assumed the 120min would be amazing. perhaps I have an unrefined pallet, but it tastes like a poorly made overly alcoholic mixed drink I would have made in college circa 2006. worth a try but I won't be having this ever again."
650,120 Minute IPA,5.0,
651,120 Minute IPA,4.1,"Got a couple of bottles of this as an x-mas gift. Bottle's a year or two old, this is the 2021 release. Poured into pint glass.
Pours a dark, rich copper tone. The short off-white head dissipates quickly, but leaves a nice ring and dense lacing. Smells a little like apple cider. I take a sip. Malt! Malt, and it's punching me in the face. Much maltier than it is hoppy- a logical progression from the 90 Minute IPA, which holds the two in balance. I wasn't sure I liked it until I kept drinking and decided I definitely do. Very sweet. Brings a caramel apple to mind, and then you get piney notes on the back end to remind you you're drinking an IPA. A little alcoholic, which works here. I wouldn't mind it being more bitter. Perfectly carbonated with a full body. 
It's a strange IPA. A prior reviewer said it reminded them of a barleywine, which does track. Another reviewer said it's not an IPA, and I'm not sure I'm equipped to argue with them. I'm not sure what it is, though, other than Very Good. While I do appreciate a beer that is what it says it is, I can also respect a beer that dares to push limits, especially when it's this good."
652,120 Minute IPA,4.18,"First, this bottle is very old. Not sure how old, but could possibly be around a dozen years old. Still have another bottle. So, with that preface...

Pours a dark copper, like dark apple cider. Opaque. Small brown head that dissipated quickly leaving a collar.

Aroma of malt, dark fruit, mild alcohol, dark sugar, spice and somewhat herbal.

Taste is dark fruit, alcohol [but not overpowering], apples, prunes, caramel, bread, bitter orange, dates and pine.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied and cleansing. Nicely smooth in the mouth.

Overall, very interesting. Hides the alcohol well and rather complex flavor notes."
653,120 Minute IPA,4.28,"As per plan, this is the Xmas celebration beer, the last holdout from the Extreme box, bottled on 9/13/19. A little over three years old, it pours a deep coppery color into the tulip with lots of head that fades off rapidly into a partial top cloud and ring. It has a sweet, syrupy, and malty smell. It does taste sweet, more sweet than bitter. The bitterness is slighty, lingering around a slight alcohol taste. I think it's like butterscotch and caramel up front. It's a little fruity, definitely along the barleywine track. Fairly thick, syrupy, easy to drink but warming. Moderately carbonated and somewhat dry. Very interesting.

I would love to do a vertical taste test. The last time I had this was in... 2019! At a tasting event that also served Utopias. It's powerful. I'm really out of the race at this point."
654,120 Minute IPA,1.0,"This is in no way an ""ipa"". It's false advertisement and a horrible beer product for $11-12 per bottle. It's all hype/gimmick. It's not satisfying at all. It's over the top in the worst way. Should be discontinued."
655,120 Minute IPA,4.73,The 2022 version is the best iteration of this beer that I've had. The hops and malt are in perfect balance for an imperial IPA.
656,120 Minute IPA,4.46,
657,120 Minute IPA,4.15,"There is no rational reason to have more than one of these per occasion. So, one brown twelve ounce bottle has been emptied into a clear pint glass. Almost no head was produced and it vanished almost instantaneously. Forget about the head, because the brew is beautiful, anyway. It's bright copper-amber and it's on the translucent side. Malt is the predominant smell, with hints of alcohol and hops. Of course, there's an alcoholic aspect to the taste that's too big to ignore. After all, the ABV here is an incredible 18 percent. Considering that, this tastes so much better than some that are less potent, but taste like a shot of whisky was dropped into the beer. This is malty in the Scottish Ale way, sweetly and with a kick. The hops are there for some counterbalance and they add an enjoyable extra layer of taste. But, this is malt and alcohol driven. It's good for what it is, an attempt at making an incredibly high ABV brew that tastes good. To that point, this is a success, for others in this range almost never taste this good. But for most beer drinkers, even those that can enjoy an Imperial IPA or stout in the 8-10% ABV range, this is a little much. There reaches a point when this much alcohol reduces the beer drinking experience and this might be it."

678,Guinness Draught,3.75,
679,Guinness Draught,3.77,"Appearance: Served from both a 14.9 nitro can and, more impressively, a tap/keg poured into a chilled Guinness pint glass. The tap/keg service, in particular, accentuates the beer's visual appeal. It presents an even more impressive creamy head that intriguingly billows down to the bottom of the glass, a spectacle that is delightfully captivating. After a 90 second wait, the drinking begins. Whether from the can or tap, the beverage exhibits heavy lacing and a long-lasting head. However, the visual drama of the pour is distinctly amplified when served from the tap.

Scent: The nose is greeted by the aromas of roasted barley and coffee.

Taste: The flavor profile carries over the scents of roasted barley and coffee, but also introduces notes of chocolate, fruity yeast, and a gentle hop presence to maintain freshness. Though not complex, it is extremely well-balanced. Despite a low grain bill, the fruitiness of the yeast and the smoothness provided by the nitro infusion alleviate any harshness from the roasted barley. The beer is surprisingly easy to drink.

Mouthfeel: The upfront creaminess from the nitro-infused head contrasts nicely with the light and slightly watery texture due to the low grain bill. This brew is easy to drink, refreshingly light, and quite popular in warm-climate countries.

Overall: This is a well-crafted light stout that is not only refreshing but also sessionable. It has become my go-to beer for St. Patrick's Day and beyond, given the nitro's gentleness on the lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Indeed, Guinness seems to be onto something - I might start finishing some of my homebrews on nitro.

This light stout's low grain profile can lead to variable harshness of flavor if not consumed fresh. Guinness on Tap/Keg presents a superior taste and creamier feel, featuring the nitro/carbonation twang without the excess harshness of the roasted barley, which can come off as an ""ashtray"" taste in cans. Think of it like the difference between freshly brewed coffee (on tap) and coffee that's been sitting on heat for a while (cans).

695,Duvel,3.51,"Re reviewing, after more beer drinking experience. All Duvel creations will always get a 5 for appearance.

Aroma is a little musky and fizzy malt, almost some banana like a wheat beer. Not my favourite aroma, I prefer more hops.

Taste is much much better than the aroma. So much yeastiness and different flavours and aromas. This is unpasteurized for sure. Pasteurization destroys every beer. Bitterness dominates, followed by a foamy hit that explodes on the tongue and wriggles down the throat, into the stomach. You can feel it as it continues it's journey.

The taste relies primarily on malt, without that much noticeble hops. It has a slight hint of being overtly fermented. A feeling that you will have a really bad headache the next day. Other beers don't give me this feeling. I would not want to drink this every day. Where as a West Coast IPA, I would be happy to drink 10 a day. If I could find 10 a day.

I much prefer the Equinox, but it's still good. But it's not as good as many West Coast IPA's or even a Chouffe IPA. This doesn't come close. It's one of the best commercial beers in the world for sure. But it needs more hops ; )"

699,Duvel,4.34,"330ml. bottle in Mae Kasa, Thailand. Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a retentive white head. Aroma of yeast, malt, hops.

704,Imperial Russian Stout,4.53,
705,Imperial Russian Stout,4.4,"Stone Imperial Russian Stout pours a deep, dark black, with a 2 finger dark tan head perched above. nicely carbonated and beautifully laced, this beer is a visual treat for stout lovers. As bold as the beer looks, the nose is surprisingly muted, but I do detect coffee, chocolate, and malt in equal measure, which is reassuring. The taste is bounces right back to the boldness of the look, and is complex. Coffee, chocolate and malt notes are there, but hops push right in. This is one of the hoppiest imperial Russian stouts I have ever had, and I find that amazingly appealing. As you swallow, a fully rounded sweet aftertaste arises... bold, like molasses. This brews' balancing act of coffee, chocolate, malt, hops, and molasses is artfully composed, and unique. Each flavor stands out, and taken as a whole, this is a fascinating brew. I have been wondering for a decade why everyone speaks lovingly of Stone Imperial Russian Stout, and now that I have tried it, I believe the rave reviews I have read are all fully justified. What can I say? I WILL be stocking up!"
706,Imperial Russian Stout,4.31,"A jet black pour produces a deep tan, creamy head. Lacing is streams and spots with varying stickiness. Feel is pretty aggressively bitter, fitting in with Stone's reputation but it has the effect of roughing up the nearly full body of the beer for me. Aromas open with chocolate and coffee emphasized in the dark malts, with the piney hops starting to play in as the beer warms up. Bitterness is up front in the taste, seeming at first coming from the hops, but the roasted notes of coffee, hiagh-cacao dark choclate, and even a little campfire ember combine and take over by mid-taste. Carbonation level is nice, keeping the dark malt richness from weighing down each sip too much."
707,Imperial Russian Stout,4.5,
708,Imperial Russian Stout,4.32,"Haven’t had this in a very long time. Found it on draft in Dallas. 

Poured into a snifter. Absolutely beautiful beer. Dark brown color with a gorgeous brown head and excellent curtain lacing. Smell and taste of dark chocolate and burnt rye toast. Licorice and dark berries. Bold bitter finish. Dry and old school. Very nice!"
709,Imperial Russian Stout,3.53,"Can. Certainly fits promotional description and some of the recent reviews. Very dark, black, lots of head, dry bitter chocolate and coffee taste. One reviewer compared it to soy sauce which I can see. Apparently a top selection of this style which I don’t seem to resonate to. My ratings reflect my preferences, would omit if I could. I think I like sweeter stouts like Oatmeal Stout better, and those with caramel notes or less bitterness."
710,Imperial Russian Stout,3.81,"Pours black with a little head. The aroma is dark malts, maybe some vanilla and hops. The taste is citrus hops, dark malts, licorice, some bitterness with a little bit of vanilla and a tad bit like soy sauce. This is an OK stout but drinks somewhat like a strong black ipa and I’d just prefer having one of those over this. Now the Espresso IRS was something special but this is a one and doner and I did have a higher opinion when I had it a few years back but many good stouts later my palette has probably shifted as it has with other beers as well, cheers!"
711,Imperial Russian Stout,4.67,
712,Imperial Russian Stout,4.17,"Canned 10/2022 (4 months ago)

Appearance: Pours a completely dark, black color with a massive dark tan head. SRM of 23-24. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, some bitter coffee roast underneath. Somewhat dry.

Flavor: Strong and rich flavors of dark chocolate, cocoa, some vanilla, dark fruit, light espresso roast. Yeasty in the middle and ultimately finishes with lingering dark chocolate notes.

Feel: Medium-bodied, strong carbonation. Somewhat clean on the palate. Surprisingly dry.

Compared to Sierra Nevada Narwal 2/2023: Pours similar with a larger head. Milder aromas. More dark chocolate and roast. Less pine. More of a roasty bitterness with less pine.

Compared to North Coast Old Rasputin 3/2023: Pours similar, darker head. Stronger aromas. More Dark chocolate, and bitter pine. Less bittersweet chocolate, English black malt and cream. Darker, heavier, and more bitter pine. 

Overall: A very-well made Russian Imperial Stout. Dark chocolate, coffee roast, yeasty, yet incredibly dry and drinkable. The drinkability and dryness is the key here and how it hides the alcohol. Only this one and Old Raspy are the two that I've had that can do this. This may be a close second to Old Raspy. (Rating: 4.17+)"

Taste, bitter chocolate, black currant (I'll buy that, If I knew what it was), molasses (slightly, I've had better), no coffee whatsoever. Hugely malted, smooth, satisfying, but thin. Massive beer, but I much prefer the old days $6 an bomber for this, and at $19 a six pack, no need to have again. One and done, the pathetic state of craft beer these days ..."
716,Imperial Russian Stout,4.0,"I do really enjoy this one. It's just plain good, not really mind-blowing but satisfying enough and good for the style. Idk why they removed the word ""Russian"" from the name for this re-release, I mean I can assume why but it's silly when you know the history of the style.

I’m in a nighttime restaurant, so… it’s dark, creamy off white cap, lots of lacing.

Sweet malt. Lots of dark fruit; raisins, plums, and figs.

Cream, maple brown sugar, and all of the dark fruit flavors.

Near full body. Smooth malt, molasses, and fermented fruits. Rich and alcoholic.

To me this style is slightly better than quads, dubbels, and trippels. Chimay Blue is my go-to for a tasty treat when I'm at good beer bars that carry it"
728,Bleue (Blue),4.25,
729,Bleue (Blue),4.74,"So, this review may not be wholly representative. 

2000 bottle of Chimay Blue plucked from the depths of Cafe Kulminator by Leen. 

Bottle is appropriately dusty and the cap is scratched, but fully intact including the seal beneath. 

The beer pour a deep burgundy red almost impenetrable by the lighting here It js still clear and clean. 

The bottom of the bottle has a ring of sediment that goes unmoved even as the bottle is tilted past 90 degrees to the horizontal. Amazing. 

Carbonation is still full, but very soft. A thin 1/3” head persisted until my first taste. It can be regenerated with swirling. 

Nose is that off a well aged beer: lots of malt with a hint of wet basement. Light floral notes persist. 

This beer is amazingly smooth. Everything blends together well and there’s bo hint of the ABV. Malt and Belgian yeast dominate. This is from before the time when Chimay changed out their fermenters. 

Compared to a fresh bottle, this is something else entirely. They are related, but distinctly different; a testament to Dirk and Leen’s care and attention. 

There are few places that revere Chimay like Kulminator. You would do well to visit and try some. Better yet, come with a small group (3) and try a multi-decade vertical. 

Enjoy it while you can. These bottles and bars are ever more limited."
730,Bleue (Blue),4.76,"Ruby-brown. Fizzy, yet creamy head. Great head retention. Sweet, cherry candy, fruity aroma. Some spice aroma. Toffee, tobacco, brown sugar, molasses. Creamy, somewhat heavy mouthfeel. Amazing, complex beer."
731,Bleue (Blue),4.75,
732,Bleue (Blue),4.85,"Malty, toasty, roasty, not too hoppy, not too sweet, but enough sweetness to balance the roasty malts. 9% but not ""hot"". Unbelievable complexity. Shifts flavors in the way only fermented foods can. Different notes come out with every sip: dried fruit, molasses, bread, chocolate, honey, spices, graham crackers, balsamic vinegar. This is top-tier for me."
733,Bleue (Blue),4.51,June 2023. Hartwell. Always a solid beer.
734,Bleue (Blue),4.38,"Pours a deep, dark brown with a 2"" toasted marshmallow head that has serious retention and lacing. Nose is sweet raisin, baked brown bread, clove and baking spice, toasted brown sugar and molasses, apple cider, gingerbread. Unlike many in the style, the raisin notes isn't overly sweet or treacly, but instead is very well balanced. Taste is similarly balanced - dark fruit (prunes, dark cherries), pumpernickel bread, and a surprising amount of earthy hop. The hop element keeps things from becoming overly sweet, and as a result, its surprisingly drinkable at 9%. There is a big alcohol kick on the palate, but it isn't overwhelming. Finish is more hop, keeping things pretty tannic, and some grassiness. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side for the ABV and with small, champagne-like carbonation."

743,Dirty Bastard,2.93,"real thick hazy caramel color with some stained fizz, head all plump like a biscuit. it doesn't smell like much to me right now, but my nose is a tad stuffy. tastes like... the left side of a boot sole? you can really see what they mean by Dirty Bastard, it's heavy and strong and it hits you hard with those delayed hops but i dunno... founders historically hasnt done a lot for me and i cant say that the dirty bastard changed my mind. reminds me of a post christmas december evening, right when its really starting to snow and you get home from work after dark and youre a little glum from the holiday season being over, and then you notice that the wet snow has soaked into your parka. i would say that Wet Snow in Clothes is the best descriptor for this one (not entirely bad)"
744,Dirty Bastard,4.5,"I’m reviewing this for the style of dark thick string beer which this is. It’s resinous and sticky and thick and taste like caramel raisins. If I wanted to sip a darker thick boy of a beer slowly this is great. 

I usually like to throw back beers though so I probably won’t be drinking this one too often. But it’s a great beer I’d have at a restaurant if I only wanted to order one. This would pair well with a juicy steak."
745,Dirty Bastard,3.79,"Early rating was a bit rough. A much better beer non-refrigerated. I do get some of the peat-y taste, more of the alcohol at the bottom. Refriged, it had like zero smell or body. I'm enjoying it much better, getting more of the taste, at room temp."
746,Dirty Bastard,4.04,"On tap at the brewery.

Appearance: Medium dark brown, very small light tan head that lingered, leaving some lacing.

Poured into a Bell's branded nonic pint glass

Look - Pours a thick and fluffy tan colored head that leaves lacing. Slightly clear, dark reddish amber appearance.
Smell - The scent is sweet toffee, roasted malt, caramel, dark cherry. No scent of alcohol.
Taste - The taste follows the nose with sweet toffee being the most dominate. Not really getting any hop taste other than a slight bitterness in the aftertaste. The alcohol is undetectable.
Feel - Medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel and finishes very dry.
Overall - The sweet toffee flavor kinda borders on overpowering, making this pretty unbalanced and almost cloyingly sweet."

Smells of toasted malts and bread. Taste is the standard caramel, toasted malts, hearty bread notes, slight sweetness, and some grassy hop flavor, but the flavor seems to disappear into a watery finish surprisingly fast. Small hop bitterness that closes the beer and forms most of the aftertaste. Medium body with a moderate carbonation mouthfeel and that out-of-place watery feel.

This would have been a fairly solid Märzen, but that watery feeling really holds it back. Won't buy again."
773,Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.3,"Sam Adams used to make a good Oktoberfest beer, which is not hard to do. The marzen style is pretty easy to nail. Unfortunately, it appears that they've watered down their marzen just as they watered down their Boston lager recently. It's still a very drinkable beer and would be rated much higher as a pils or a dark lager. But there is virtually no hint of the marzen style in this beer."

Country Boy Oktoberfest is the best I've sampled thus far, but my goodness a 6-pack of 12-ounce cans is $14. Too damn expensive.

Taste is very honey forward - reminds me most of those honey straws you bite the ends of and chew down. Spicy barley notes as well which give it some more savory notes that help prevent this from becoming too sweet. Light bitterness comes through long on the finish.

815,West Coast IPA,4.02,"Only photos could describe the foamy white mess that rises above the top of a clear glass liter mug. It’s that pathetic. Really, no beer pour, especially an IPA should ever have this much stark white starchy foam pretending to be a head. This is the consequence of trying to fit two twelve ounce cans' contents into the vessel. With patience, the foam recedes and there becomes almost a true beer head. Obviously, there are concerns, as big white foamy and starchy heads often lead to taste and mouthfeel disappointments. The aroma is of OK piney hoppiness; but, so far, it's looks over aroma and looks have a big negative lead. The color isn't the problem. It's a rich and bright dark amber that's close to being translucent. Actually, it's a pretty good looking brew once the head recedes. Much as expected, this is a nicely West Coast hopped rendition, without much of a malt inclusion to carry it via its body, nor to give it a counterbalance so necessary for a great IPA. The ratings here may be inconsistent, but that sums up the brew. There's good color, but bad lacing. There's a nice sharp piney hop bite, but no malt balance, nor backbone. This isn't bad and the tastes of those that want hoppiness, even at the expense of a malty presence, will like this. To taste, it's a nicely dry hopped ale. To anyone that loves a traditional IPA, the lack of barley malt in the mix will spoil this."
816,West Coast IPA,4.18,"Slightly hazy, rich amber appearance with a generous, fine bubbled head that left rings of good lacing. Big time piney, resinous hop aroma, some citrus, with an initial hit of sweetness that fades after a few moments. Medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. The profuse amount of hops engage the palate from the start well into the lingering, long lasting finish"
817,West Coast IPA,4.3,"From a 12oz can dated 12/13/21 into a pint glass.

Pours a translucent brownish orange with about a half finger of with head (gentle pour). Ok retention and lacing.

Smells of fresh cut grass and pint. Also got a hint of marijuana.

Piney, resiny, bitter taste. 95 IBUs in their glory-Right in the wheelhouse for a WCIPA. Some malts in there as well-bit of caramel. 

Very sticky mouthfeel-full bodied. Strong bitter aftertaste. Medium carbonation.

This is a WCIPA. Hit the mark squarely. And stinking enjoyable too."

Bottled On Date: 11/20/2016
Consumed on: 20 Nov, 2022
Glass: Snifter
ABV: 10.5%
Serving Temp: 49.3 F


Look: 
Jet black with a brown head that is very thin. The head quickly dissipates to a ring with some film over parts of the beer. What lacing exists is excellent.

Smell: 
Dark, bittersweet chocolate and coffee. Char. Molasses. Anise. Caramelized and somewhat burnt sugar. A fair amount of earth.

Taste: 
An earthy and bitter hit up front, but nothing overwhelming. This becomes char, dark chocolate, and some coffee. Molasses and anise follow. The earthy notes return towards the end. The sip finishes bittersweet and this lingers into and through the aftertaste which is very much unsweetened chocolate.

Feel: 
Silky and mouth-coating. A nice warmth from the alcohol. The body is only a shade or 2 lighter than full.

Overall: 
An excellent (Russian) Imperial Stout. One of my favorites of the style. I buy it when I see it. Which last was in 2019.

I purchased this beer fresh back in December, 2016. It has been in my cellar ever since. It has handled its age (6 years) quite well I would say."

A: Pours basically black with a frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a light layer and leaves a little nice lacing. 

S: Roasty, earthy, a little char, dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, burnt sugar, slight umami notes, and faint hints of dark fruit. 

T: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, black coffee, a little char, earthy, molasses a touch of toffee, and faint dark fruit on the finish. 

M: Full body, mild carbonation, creamy smooth. 

O: Somehow I think this one went straight from the store to my cellar and has been there ever since, so it's about time I crack into it! 
Total time capsule back to before every imperial stout was loaded up with adjuncts and it's aged beautifully. Another example of why Founders is quite possibly the best at brewing dark beers."

F - thick mouthfeel with minimal carbonation

830,Imperial Stout,4.43,"Single 12 ounce bottle from Founders in Grand Rapids Nov 2019 when travel was still a thing.
Pours pitch black with finger of creamy mildly reddish brown head.
Aroma of dark fruits, caramel, mildly roasty with notes of chocolate and just a hint of coffee.
Taste is rich with plummy note, chocolate; a brief wave of smoke drifts across the palate, caramel malt and a touch of espresso bitterness balancing the sweetness.
Rich and smooth full creamy mouthfeel with a hint of boozy heat - wonderfully bittersweet. Wish more had followed me home."

Smell: Roasted coffee beans, malts, caramel, dark chocolate.

Taste: Chocolate, cacao, malts, coffee. Also getting some dried fruits - possibly cranberry or cherry.

Feel: Creamy thick mouthfeel, this thing just rips as it goes down. Has a dark feel to it (literally and figuratively), great for sipping with a book. Gets better as it warms.

It still has a decent amount of carbonation and a nice little ring of foam. It was meant to age, this is telling me. Smells like coffee, alcohol, chocolate, and hops. Prominent alcohol flavor, even at chilled temps and with the age on it. This was a bad boy back in the day, I bet.

842,Racer 5,1.41,"I rated this great West Coast IPA years ago with a rating over 4.4 under a now lost username. I have some bad news about my favorite Northern California IPA.
Bear Republic Brewing Co. of Cloverdale, California was acquired by Drake's Brewing Co. of San Leandro, California early in 2023. Newspaper stories of the time stated that Drake's would be brewing Racer 5 again from their brewery in San Leandro. Drake's acquired all of the Bear Republic intellectual property including recipes, trademarks and packaging rights.
Well, that was the story, at least.
I was a purchaser of Racer 5 in 12-pack bottles. The cardboard boxes stated that it was brewed in Sonoma County. On June 12 of 2023 I purchased what I believed to be Bear Republic Racer 5 IPA. This cardboard box claimed Racer 5 was brewed in San Jose with a bottling date of May 11, 2023. The brew contained in these bottles was not the same Racer 5 that I dearly loved. The substantial layer of brewer's yeast at the bottom of each bottle was gone, meaning that this brew was no longer a genuine bottle-conditioned IPA. The head was gone. Carbonation was nearly flat. The full-bodied ""IPA"" was now thin and watered down like any cheap canned ""IPA."" Odd smell and off-taste. The complex hops profile was absent and now tasted suspiciously of Citra or Galaxy. I made a call to Drake's and they told me that Racer 5 was now brewed by Gordon Biersch of San Jose. They assured me that when Drake's started production of Racer 5 the boxes would be marked as brewed in San Leandro.
That's the miserable end of Racer 5 for me. I will watch for future production of Racer 5 from San Leandro should that actually happen. Sorry to be the bearer (no pun intended) of bad news."
843,Racer 5,3.65,"Aroma was malty and slightly piney, medium carb, two finger head. Taste - very malty, bready and thick with butterscotch notes. Lots of sticky piney hop bittering. Not sure how this differs from a New England IPA but nonetheless it ain't no West Coast IPA despite the fact it's brewed on the West Coast. So I guess for the style is right on. This is a classic IPA from Bear Republic so definitely a must try if you're an IPA connoissieur."
844,Racer 5,5.0,
845,Racer 5,5.0,"Pours a delightful hazy orange with a voluminous off-white head that lasts, giving epic lacing.
Smell is sweet caramel, oranges, apricots, and slight honeydew.
Taste follows the smell nicely with no off flavors. A bit less honeydew in the taste, and a bit more apricot and orange. Sweet, or perhaps semi-sweet... Malt-forward, but still quite hoppy with a lasting bitter finish.
Feel is very smooth and full-bodied; carbonation is moderate and just right for this style. ABV is there, but not pressing.
Overall, an under-rated, old-school, west-coast IPA that is a must try for all die-hard IPA lovers."

847,Racer 5,4.21,
848,Racer 5,3.73,
849,Racer 5,3.86,"Poured from an unfortunately undated 16oz can

On the first pour an insane four finger head formed. Pretty good retention too, as it took me 6ish minutes to pour the whole pint into a Spieglau IPA glass. After pouring I had a stiff rocky white sudsy head that left foamy lacing. Body is a hazy golden yellow.

Aroma comes off as sweet, in a big beer sense, but is immediately followed by big resiny hops with rhindy citrus notes in the back. Like if pine sap was lemon scented? Super hoppy but in a fresh herbal way. A touch of ""ale"" character in the way back.

Flavor is smooth and drinkable with a wave of bitterness. Tasting notes mostly follow the aroma, but the sweetness dissapears completely, due to the bitterness. Full flavor implies a maltiness, but the hops cover up any true malt character, as typical for the style. Lemony pine resin with a dry malt insinuating finish is the main experience.

Feel is drinkable verging on dangerous for the ABV. Very easy to drink and quite smooth, although the finish is quite dry and bitter. The dryness begins verging on astringency, and I'm unsure if that is due to hopping rates, or something else. Very full with a medium long finish.

Overall this is a decent legacy IPA. It's super drinkable, very ""beery"" and pretty enjoyable. Bright herbal citric and overall hoppy, this is what I thought an IPA tasted like when my mom explained hops to me as a kid, and I still didn't appreciate beer. Classic old school IPA, this is what a WCIPA should be IMO."

852,Racer 5,4.49,"Been some time since had a Racer 5 - ?San Francisco 2017??
Pours a bright very slightly hazed golden with solid two fingers of tight bubbly just off white head.
Aroma of bready malt, floral with touch of pine and big swath of orange, tangerine and tropical fruit - underwhelming at first but popped as warmed just a touch (this is on me!).
Tastes an explosion of hops - citrus, a bit of pine, fruity with notes of mango, tangerine; certainly a floral presence and a bright spicy bitterness that coats the palate balanced by bready caramel malt sweetness.
Medium full mouthfeel with a coating bittersweetness that lingers nicely.
This is a classic for a reason and on a short list of ""desert island"" beers."

Appearance: Very dark brown, nearly black. Small tan head lingered and left moderate lacing.

Nose: Rich roast.

Finish: Gentle bitterness from the malt — perfect.

870,Porter,4.14,"Had on tap at Bulldog Saloon Lynnwood, WA"
871,Porter,4.34,"APPEARANCE
Absolutely black out. Pitch black in all regards with no red or brown on the edges. The pour produced a hefty three fingers of off-white head.

AROMA
Lots of roast and I mean A LOT. It's like a cup of coffee though I don't think it is specifically brewed with any coffee. I get some sweet caramel notes and even some vanilla. A good hint of chocolate syrup rounds out what is turning into a decadent dessert beer. 

TASTE
I tell ya that roast from the aroma is singing just as loud and proud here on the taste. It's bordering on burnt coffee, but is reeled in just enough where it is just dark roast. With that comes a big blast of bitterness, but it is quite pleasant. My next swig just got me a ton of that chocolate syrup which brings us right back to dessert beer territory. Subtle caramel notes in the front and the end is more of that coffee bitterness.

MOUTHFEEL
Not too thick, but not watered down. Very smooth and velvety as the brewer's description prepared me for. Despite all that coffee bitterness it is a pleasure to drink and it doesn't leave behind a sticky film despite all the sweet flavors.

OVERALL
Lives up to its reputation and then some. It's a robust porter at a reasonable ABV and is available year round. A winner in all aspects."
872,Porter,4.08,"A fairly straightforward brew. Not as sweet or milky as I expected from the nose. Expresso, dark chocolate, hoppy bitterness, I get the graham cracker, and faint sweetness. Taste is rich and unfortunately mouthfeel lacks silkiness to support that.

Pours a deep brown coffee, totally opaque and with a tall head (aggressive pour, my bad) but leaves behind a fine and spidery lacing with a tall domed cap. Settled into a 1/4 ring with no signs of disappearing. 4.5

Off the bottle I get some dark and roasty coffee but accompanied by a fair bit of sweetness too. Off the glass I pick up the same but the sweetness gives off a bit of char and a bigger dose of roasted malts. 4.5

Dark coffee again, char, good punch of hop balance, bitterness of coffee starts to come out as it warms up. 4.5

Body is incredibly soft and rich, with a slight oiliness and mouthcoating. Carbo is very light and delicate, even for being freshly bottled, I could swear it was aged. 4.75

S: Oranges, grapefruit rind, grainy pale malt, and light notes of dry pine needles. As the beer opens up I also get light notes of caramel malt.

T: This one follows the nose pretty closely. I get oranges, grainy and biscuity malt character, a bit of pine, and a light grapefruit bitterness on the backend and finish.

F: Medium body with medium-low carbonation. The mouthfeel is smooth and slick with a light dryness on the finish.

O: This one packs in a lot of flavor for a session ipa. It reminds me of Lawson's Super Session series. Easy drinking, flavorful, and all for a decent price. It's not the best IPA in the world, but as far as session IPAs go it is definitely in my top 10."

A closer sniff said something closer to overripe bananas foster with a hint of nutmeg. Nutmeg comes up first from a fairly rough mouth feel, then something boozy and a little dry that overpowers any fruitiness. Now, it is certainly possible that this has lost a step since it has been sitting in my fridge for a couple months while I abstained from alcohol.

Mouthfeel: Medium heavy.

Attack: Pumpkin spice nicely balance by hops, carbonation and alcohol evident.

Finish: Medium hop bitterness.

916,Pumking,3.66,"Light caramel in color with a slightly white head. Can't discern too much immediate pumpkin notes that makes me think this is pumpkin pie in a glass. Definitely some enjoyable cereal grain malt notes. It comes off as fairly boozy and at 8.6% it definitely is. 
I think this is a good beer but it's not ""pumpkin pie in a glass"" as advertised. Clove, some nutmeg, but lots of cereal grains and intermeshed bitter notes. I'm not sure what's going on because a lot of reviews are saying this tastes extremely pumpkin pie like and others are decrying it as being watered down. I'm definitely in the latter camp because this is coming up pretty short in the sweet pumpkin pie regard. It is a good and strong imperial beer but comes off closer to a barleywine than a pumpkin ale. Frankly there might be some quality control issues somewhere in the manufacturing or supply chain that are creating such a variance in assessments of this beer."

926,Bigfoot,3.91,"A 2023 iteration bottled on January 12, 2023 and poured into a tulip about five months later.

Pours dark/amber brown. Excellent head. Initially, it releases big bubbles from the bottom of the pour that slowly bubble up. Good retention and lacing. 

Aromas of dark fruit and piney hops, along with some modest citrus. 

The brew delivers initial sticky-bready caramel-malt sweetness balanced almost immediately by white pepper and pine hoppiness. As the brew warms, a distinct grapefruit citrus note rounds out the middle, along with raisin, peach, and molasses. Some anise, tobacco and leather are trying to manifest, but need some time to mature. Not as boozy as feared. There are quite a few different things going on here. 

Full bodied for sure, it nevertheless is very drying and tingly, which makes each sip welcome.

Overall, I understand why this brew can be polarizing, because there is nothing subtle or nuanced about a newer bottle of this brew. Regardless, this is a very flavorful American Barleywine that is excellent, but would probably be better with a little more age to smooth things out from what is currently pretty wild."

Up front, I'll admit that the word ""Barleywine"" grabbed my eye and I missed the word, ""Style"". While after buying the first sixpack for (at our store) a very reasonable price of $11.50 I then came back for the other four, I liked it very much for what it was, not what it purported to be. If you are looking for a Barleywine, this isn't it. If instead, you are looking for an very excellent dark imperial IPA this is the one! Hops to spare and definitely a worthwhile pint to keep in your stock. If this sounds like it works for you then by all means grab some. I am glad I found it."
928,Bigfoot,4.1,"12 ounce bottle, fridge chilled. Dark amber, khaki foam.
Aroma is a bit all over and it takes a moment to call out the pine and malt and woods.
Taste is malty and hops balanced at first drink, then comes apart on the palate., caramel, pine, white pepper. Solid bitterness. Alcohol is present, as it should be for the American Barleywine style.
Feel is mid-weight, mid-carb.
Overall, good sud, a little busy, but not in a bad way. Better as it warms."
929,Bigfoot,3.96,
930,Bigfoot,4.07,"Big flavors, thick, grainy consistency. Dry and bitter, malt heavy first impression then the hops kick in with a piny and powdery finish. Some bitter gentian root flavors (cocktail bitters), a little too much sometimes. Raisins. Herbal. Mild sweetness is beaten back by the massive malt and hops. Very similar to a double or triple IPA. If you like big and bitter, this is it."
931,Bigfoot,4.81,"Look - deep amber, aggressive pour for a 2"" tan head, little lacing left after this session
Smell - woody, malty, piney, floral, spicy
Taste - toasted malt, sweet caramel, hoppy, black pepper, piney, citrus
Feel - medium body and carbonation, sticky piney resinous finish, peppery
Overall - My first Barleywine and I'm very impressed. There is some serious hop nectar going on here. Flavor is very rich, almost like you're drinking the hops extract concentrate straight from the can and the enormous malt body brings the balance of toasted malt and a bit of sweet caramel. This brew is right up my alley with intense hoppy, piney, bitter traits that linger after every sip. Originally I bought one to try and that turned into buying a couple of six packs after I did try it. I'm gonna save a few to age and drink them in the years to come. Bigfoot is definitely a beast so take your time and pair it with the long classic, Do You Feel Like We Do from the Frampton Comes Alive! album. Enjoy!"
932,Bigfoot,4.29,"2023 vintage:

Poured from a 12 ounce bottle dated 1/19/23 into a snifter.

Look- Amber brown, light brown frothy head, no visible particulate, average lacing, above average head retention.

Smell- Bready, earthy, pine, boozy, barley, medium strength of scent.

Taste- Bready, toasted barley, pine, citrus, black pepper, boozy, high strength of flavor.

Feel- Full body, average carbonation, highly mouth warming, highly bitter, mildly mouth coating, moderately creamy.

Overall- Amber brown in color with no visible particulate and above average head retention. Bouquet was malt forward with medium strength and notes of pine and booze. Taste was high in strength and malt forward with pine, citrus and black pepper character. Feel was full bodied with plenty of mouth warming and bitterness. Overall this provided a nice drinking experience and was a very enjoyable example of the style."

946,Dale's Pale Ale,2.32,not a fan personally.
947,Dale's Pale Ale,3.37,"Acclimated to 50°F and poured into an American pint glass.

Pours a clear, dark dark gold, maybe bronze, with a 2 finger foamy lasting white head with heavy and sturdy lacing.

whiffs of hop and marijuana while looking. Initial aroma is lightly hoppy with a slight marijuana/skunk presence. Smells slightly watery or diluted, with notes of grapefruit pith/rind. Smells almost sanitary somehow? The marijuana note and diluted feeling fade after smelling a while, and the grapefruit becomes stronger. After agitating the hops become stronger.

Initial taste before swallowing is sweet, bitter, and slightly dank with grapefruit rind and caramel like maltiness. After swallowing, the grapefruit rind becomes a full on grapefruit oil taste that lasts into the aftertaste along with the sweet maltiness, sitting on the middle top and sides of the tongue. The hops manifest on the swallow, bright and dry. A black pepper kick is revealed in the roof of the mouth in the late aftertaste, and a vague pine taste can be found throughout. The bitterness builds as I drink. It felt to me as though the flavors were were a little disjointed, though that's likely entirely personal preference, they worked alright.

Mouthfeel is slightly creamy and smooth, which is enjoyable. It goes down easy, sort of crashing around the mouth.

I don't think I'll buy again honestly. It was honestly good, I just don't love it overall. Decent price though, so maybe!"
948,Dale's Pale Ale,4.06,

Feel - medium light body, low carbonation, pine resinous finish
Overall - Wow! I remember the first time I had this and today I have the same thought. Can't believe this is a pale ale. It drinks like a west coast IPA with the pine sappy aftertaste and pine resinous finish. I know there's thousands of options out there today but don't sleep on this one. Pick it up if you've never tried it or pick it up again if you have. Dale's is a classic tasty brew that I will enjoy again and again. Pairs up nicely with Back for More by Ratt."
952,Dale's Pale Ale,3.82,"Picked up some of these on St. Patrick's Day to try for Half & Halfs. Decided to try one again today on its own.

L: Pours a rich copper with a 3 finger, almost creamy, beige head with excellent retention. Leaves nice lacing and when the head finally dissipates, it leaves a thick, beige cap. A little dark for the style, but otherwise gorgeous.

S: Fairly simple, yet quite pleasing. Sweet malt and grapefruit/floral notes from the hops.

T: Flavors follow the nose, but the sweet is toned down a bit by the hop bitterness, which is welcomed for this style of beer. This really combines nicely into a pretty nice session beer.

F: Ample carbonation, pretty crisp and finishes extra dry. Good for sessions, but you may need some water on hand to combat the dry mouth.

O: Pretty solid beer overall. My Main gripe with this beer is the extra dry finish. While I am a fan of beers with a semi-dry or even dry finish, depending on style, this one is just a bit too much for me. Was decent for Half & Halfs (the hop bitterness was actually a little too forward). This Pale Ale definitely tows the line of IPA, but is an interesting take on an American Pale Ale."

961,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.46,"9/8/23 On tap at Chili's in Uniontown, PA. Visited after our first Lyme's disease trial shot.

Not much in the nose considering the decent bready banana wheat spice notes. 

I consider this a nice decent average mass produced witbier."
962,Blue Moon Belgian White,3.73,"24 oz can acclimated to 48°F and poured into a tulip glass.

Pours hazy, the color of apricot juice, nice color. Produces a 1 finger white head, dissipating quickly and leaving lacing that fades quickly.

Initial aroma is orange peel and juice with some yeast, slight note of hay maybe? After agitating I'm hit with a funky and cooling smell that reminds me of sea spray.

Initial taste before swallowing feels like it hits the same receptors as salt, it's juicy and yeasty with a peachy and apricot taste. After swallowing I first taste a peachy/fruity/nectar/juicy taste. I then notice a fermented/bread/dough/yeast taste that seems to grow in intensity when the other tastes fade. In the aftertaste is a bitterness that I don't find pleasant, sort of a rotten vegetable taste.

Mouthfeel is rather juicy, feeling heavy, and somewhat sticky, but not syrupy. Dare I say, silky. It's the proper descriptor, but implies a little higher quality than I'd call it.

Overall it's good for the price. It's not amazing and it's not got many layers of flavor, but it satisfied me well enough. I did enjoy the yeasty bread taste quite a bit, and the mouthfeel was impressive. Would be a decent session beer if kept at the recommended temperature and not allowed to warm too much.

Not likely to buy again, I've had it in the past but wanted to try again, maybe in several years like I did this time. I might, but whatever."

Poured from a 330ml bottle, this beer is very cloudy light orange , an inch thick tightly bubbled head forms bit is short lived and leaves no lacing , highly carbonated looking. The smell is of yeast ,fruit and light malt and the taste follows this with the addition of the classic , for this style , addition of orange and coriander. Its slightly sweet and bitter in a nicely rounded way and has a nice mildly dry finish . Very fizzy with a good viscosity.

Aroma is mainly malty with overtones of cereal grain and grapefruit. Taste is bitter throughout but very well balanced with the malty sweetness and spicy alcohol flavor on the follow through. The bitterness lingers with creamy thickness in the mouth for this medium to full bodied brew. There is even a nice carbonation tingle on the tongue. It's been so long since I've had one of these that I had forgotten how good they are. This is an iconic ale that lives up to the hype.

With an ABV of over 11%, this beer does not come off as overly boozy, despite its aging in bourbon and French oak barrels. Finally, there is a finish of sarsaparilla and milky molasses. 

This beer will only get better with age. I see this beer as mellowing its edges with another year or two (if you can wait that long), on the shelf, aging."

More of the bitter Chocolate and Coffee end of the spectrum. It is mellow, and not boozy (for me). Mouth feel is medium, and not too chewy. Just right actually.

Some slight hints of this beers age come through in the nose, but not enough to be offensive. As many other reviews state, there is a lot going on in this offering. Every sip offers up a new flavor or aroma that I did not pick out in the previous. The barrel aged flavor complements this beer instead of overpowering it.

1051,Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.84,"This is the 2022 vintage with Burundian Turihamwe coffee blend from Intelligentsia. Poured from the 16.9 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. 

Look: The beer is a pure opaque black with no light coming through. Topped with a creamy finger thick head with OK retention. This is a real imperial looking stout.

Smell: Creamy aroma of mocha and fresh espresso. Deep chocolate notes throughout. Not as much bourbon as in the original variant on first glance, which may be a good thing. This is inviting. Dark fruits somewhere within. As the beer warms, more of the bourbon and woody noes come out a bit. Vanilla makes an appearance as well as this warms, and a slight spice.

Taste: Chocolatey up front with notes of mocha in between roasted and toasted malt. Some vanilla quickly covered up by bourbon, which is immediately more evident than in the aroma. Brown sugar, creme caramel. Surprising that this beer retains a sweeter than expected character throughout. Finishes with just as touch of bourbon underneath a really smooth, almost fruity and spicy coffee note. Again not as heavy handed with the bourbon, which is definitely there, but much more nuanced.

Feel: Creamy with light carbonation. Coating. Finishes smooth with just a hint of tingling alcohol at the very end.

Overall: Oh yeah, this is a good one. I love that it doesn't try to hammer you over the head with the bourbon flavor. Instead it slowly brings you in with a wide variety of flavors. The spotlight here is the Turihamwe coffee blend, which really makes a difference in the flavor profile that shows in the end product. A premium product for sure, but it lives up to expectations, revealing something new at every sip. A special experience that will probably show up in my top 10."

1069,Oberon,3.76,"Beautiful pour…deep yellow gold with a healthy white foam head. Muted notes of bread, grassy wheat, and light sweet floral notes. Tastes of malts, wheat , slight phenolic sand a hint of sweetness. Great mouthfeel…silky smooth on the tongue with carbonation and little on the lower side of medium.

1079,Oberon,3.97,"Look: Turbid orange on the pour which excites a billowing white head to form and hold, slowly relenting and leaving sheets of lacing behind
Aroma: Freshly baked wheat bread, wheat malt, wafts of citrus, yeast, and light phenolics
Taste: Wheat bread and a ton of it hit hard and fast up front as light citrus notes trickle in behind and join. Yeast jumps into the fray in the middle along with light herbal phenolics and wheat, yeast, and citrus intermingle throughout the close
Mouthfeel: Full, silky smooth, medium-high carbonation, and soft and smooth on the finish
Overall: I love this beer. I was fortunate enough to try several Bell’s beers years ago when they first tried breaking into the Oregon market and always had a soft spot for this, so was an easy purchase when I saw it locally again. A classic American Wheat with lots of tasty wheat character and not heavy on the traditional Hefe yeast phenolics so an easy crowd pleaser I feel. Well-made, delicious, and super crushable – what else do you need. Recommended"
1080,Speedway Stout,4.35,"Poured from a 16 ounce can, the body is very dark and opaque. Small initial head and light lacing. 

Aroma is mix of malty char, dark chocolate and coffee. Delightful.

Taste follows nose with an increased flavor of the coffee. Add a nice boozy flavor, not too hot. I'd prefer a bit more char, but this beer is delicious.

At first, a lighter mouthfeel than expected/hoped for but still solid. Once warmed, the mouthfeel was nicely creamy. Carbonation light."

Aroma: Espresso, roasted barley, baker’s cocoa, ethanol, blackstrap molasses, freshly baked bread, dark cherries, light earthiness, and piloncillo
Taste: Starts out with a ton of rich, dark chocolate that hinges on the edge of full-blown bitter cocoa and quickly joined by espresso, light cherry, and roast. These go back and forth with a nice bread/earthy profile in the middle with subtle caramel, molasses, and piloncillo hanging around, peeking in occasionally and closes with cocoa, coffee, and ethanol
Mouthfeel: Full, silky smooth, medium carbonation, and a smooth finish with a slight robust edge
Overall: This is outstanding stuff. I’ve only had this beer a few times in my craft beer experience and I forgot just how well-made and tasty it is, especially for such a big beer. Coffee, dark chocolate, roast, earthiness, malt sweetness, and alcohol come together in harmony to make this tasty libation and glad to have the chance to try it again. Recommended"

Strong mocha aroma with light alcohol and just a touch of chalk. Some fine background Subsequent smells lean more toward the chocolate than the coffee.

The taste reminds me of powdered unsweetened cocoa. The body is full but not oily despite the high abv of 12%. This is enhanced with a lower carbonation level. The taste becomes more bitter with a coffee ground flavor coming through in the swallow. Long bitter Baker's chocolate aftertaste."
1092,Speedway Stout,4.49,"Purchased at Bound Beverage, Warrington, PA. $16.50/4pk (16oz cans)

Pours a welcoming, dark, dark brown/nearly black color. A one finger, dense, beige colored head that fades to a ring around the glass.

Aromas of sweet chocolate and roasted malts.

A delicious mix of sweet chocolate, coffee, caramel-like toffee and deep roasted malts. All the flavors meld together for a nearly perfect imperial stout. The 12% ABV is well hidden but you’ll need to respect it and take your time sipping this brew.

A creamy, heavier consistency. Low to moderate carbonation. Leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste.

Overall, an excellent stout. I’d love to try this aged in bourban barrels. Highly recommended…Cheers!"
1093,Speedway Stout,4.66,"Poured from a pint can with into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Very dark brown — approaching black — with a 1 1/2”dark tan head that lingered and left nice lacing.

Nose: Dark roast, coffee, a little chocolate.

Mouthfeel: Heavy, perfect for a beer of this horsepower.

Attack: Omigoodness — dark roast following the nose; coffee, toffee, chocolate.

Finish: Alcohol, roast bitterness to balance the attack.

This is the epitome of an Imperial Stout. Totally deserves its world-class rating. So well balanced! Flavorful, drinkable, though I enjoy it as a sipper. There’s no beer I’d rather pair with a rich chocolate dessert, though today it’s doing just fine with mixed, lightly salted nuts."
1094,Speedway Stout,3.94,"This is an ABV bomb at 12%. The look in a glass is quite lovely with a dark body and (thin) head. The smell is of strong coffee together with an almost bourbon or rye smell, most likely due to the high alcohol level. The taste is strong and close to syrupy. This is more of a desert beer and indeed I took my time sipping this one. I prefer lower ABV beers than this one, but for the style, it is a solid effort."

1098,Speedway Stout,4.26,"Received in a proxy/trade hybrid from @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drunk in November of that year.

L: A very thin, caramel-coloured head sits atop an inky, black glass of thick-looking, dead-still beer. No light penetrates the veil and no carbonation is visible. 

S: The nose has roasted chocolate and coffee beans. Rich, gooey toffee sits beneath. 

T: The first thing to note is the absolute lack of booze on the palate. There's none present on the way down and no sting on the tongue. I suspect this beer hides its weapons in plain sight. I don't see them yet, and I don't feel them now, but when they kick in I'm going to wonder what hit me.

Tastewise, there's coffee, but it's quite subtle. There's a layer of milky chocolate and, as I always perceive in stouts these days, a raspberry and cola note. There's some residual sweetness after the swallow that stops me from crushing what would otherwise be a reasonably quick-drinking beer.

The ability of this beer to hide its 12% gives it extra marks. 

M: The beer is smooth and oily on the mouth but there's the slightest thinness that I think comes from the lack of booze in the flavour. 

O: With mouthfeel being the only knock on this beer, it's an extremely enjoyable drink. The sweetness never gets cloying and the booze never gets uncomfortable. I wouldn't want more than one, but that's ok in the case of this beer as I'd regret two of these the next day!

Cheers!

1099,Speedway Stout,4.54,"Notes from 6/19/2022.
Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter.
The beer is jet black with a small head that quickly dissipates to a thin cap.
The intensity of aroma is medium. The aroma has dark chocolate, strong cold brewed coffee, and maybe a hint of cinnamon. There's a slight sweetness in the aroma.
The intensity of taste is high. The flavor has strong dark coffee and dark chocolate that are so well balanced that they quickly fluctuate. The underlying maltiness is sweet, the hops are spicy and are both in balance with the coffee and chocolate flavors. 
The thickness is, well, thick. It's a little slick, very creamy, and the astringency is medium and in balance with the carbonation which is slightly above low.
Overall, the balance of flavors and the balance of elements in the mouth feel is masterful. I like that the intensity of aroma is moderate and it made me unprepared for how very strong the flavor is. It's a world class imperial stout that I anticipate getting again."

1111,Traditional Lager,3.32,"This is a very serviceable lager. Though technically not a macro or AAL, I put it in the same category and it is my favorite of the group. In a cooler full of AALs at a party, I'm going with this one every time. The main drawback for me is that I get almost no aroma, which is unfortunate.

I find that there can be some variability. Sometimes a get nice caramel, honey on dark bread. Other times the caramel seems more syrupy. Either way, for the price and purpose, this will do just fine."

My only issue is that when drunk from a bottle, I have definitely encountered entire 6 packs that are ""off"" and skunky. On tap and from cans are definitely better options, as I fear that the green glass bottles lend themselves to sun damage. Yuengling Traditional Lager is going to always be a yes from me."

Flavor is equally complex - lots of spice from the rye, sweet molasses, wood, Canadian whiskey, light vanilla, sugar in the raw. It manages to avoid becoming an overly boozy nightmare while still highlighting the spirit barrels, all without loading up on sugars and adjuncts. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, though not so much as BCBS; there's also some light carb as well. Pretty exceptional."

S: Getting a sweet bourbon cherry aroma from the first sniff, can definitely smell some coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and oak in there. Very well done on the nose! It hit all the marks that they advertised and it was very noticeable/ well balanced. This deserves a 5/5 for me.
T: Tasting bourbon, cherry up front as the nose indicates. Getting some big coffee, chocolate, vanilla and oak as the nose followed. It's rare the nose is tasting the exact same in a similar order to the nose.

O: I can see why this is a world class beer. this big 13.5% beer showed us what we can expect on the firestone walker website and this is exactly what we got.

1135,Parabola,2.9,"2022. It didn't taste like a Russian Imperial Stout to me, too sweet, in fact I think Rasputin is a better representative. And forget about comparing it to Sam Smith's RIS. I was thankful the bourbon still came through strong which did a lot for the taste. I think the most noticeable things about this beer are its ABV of 14.1% and it's ""weight"", both of which put it in the one-and-done category...and that's if you can finish the 12 oz bottle, which I was barely able to do after about 2 hours from the time I poured it. The ABV and the weight really work against the enjoyability of this beer."

I am not an expert on the true evaluation of the RIS but I fell in love with this one after my first trip to Firestone/Walker in El Paso de Robles about 12 or 13 years ago. This started me on RIS style. F/W have a cellar room where you can buy the good stuff. I recommend a visit, as the wine country out there is fabulous and F/W is affiliated with many of the wineries (sourcing casks, mixers, etc). The beer is complex and has so many taste notes to it that I won't try to guess them all. It should satisfy almost anyone. I highly recommend putting one away for a few years. I have a few more. Tonight my wife is celebrating her 60th, and I will be having a 5 year old Deschutes Abyss or two after the Tomahawk Ribeye BBQ tonight. But for now, nothing better to set off this great celebration than my all time favorite, Parabola!"

Perfect brown head rises above a deep black sea and leaves a nice ring inside the glass. Drizzly lacing.
Smells wonderful - dark malt, chocolate, coffee, prune, licorice, barrel char.
Drinking like a millionaire. All of the aromas spill forth into the mouth and everybody takes a bow. Multiple barrels makes for a taster’s experience. The peppery spice of the rye barrel carries long, which helps cut into the sweet elements of this Russian Imperial Stout. Vanilla. Fudge. Barrel.,. on and on.
Feel is not overly dense, which I appreciate. Medium carbonation.
Overall - World Class Stout and totally worthy. The art of the craft!"
1139,Parabola,4.98,"I'm reviewing the 2021 3 barrel aged release because it's my new favourite parabola release ever.

Pours how you would expect for a big stout. Motor oil on the pour itself then dark black in the glass.

Smells amazing. Tons of roasted malt coffee notes, subtle chocolate, big whisky barrels on the nose, the rye barrel gives a distinct note which is sort of like burnt rye bread (big surprise). I'm not getting any cherry but maybe some faint hint of fig. Zero ethanol on the nose.

The taste is really good. The rye barrel shines here as it balances the bourbon sweetness. Lots of roasted malt, some coffee notes, some sweet bourbon mixed with subtle rye spice, good oak that gives a touch of vanilla character. The finish is long and is very barrel heavy, which I like.

Mouthfeel is like 2% thinner than I'd like but I think that might be a carbonation thing rather than the actual gravity. It's still nice and full bodied for me.

This is actually my favourite beer right now. I love what the rye and wheated whisky barrels did for the balance of the flavour profile. This is probably the most balanced big stout I've ever had, especially among barrel aged stouts. I think this is well worth the price. 2021 was a great year for parabola."

The taste- I grabbed the can again to verify, but vanilla plays top position. Not sweet at all, but no mistaking there is vanilla in here. Coffee shows up later, this drinks true as it warmed.

Pours a very dark brown with just a finger of espresso colored head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing and decent legs

The aroma here is sweet but not overly so, bringing a nice balance of vanilla, hazelnut, toast, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, and a slight dark fruit note

A bittersweet balance is maintained throughout the entire sip, starting off with notes of cocoa powder, lightly toasted malt, raisin, and a touch of grain alcohol. The swallow makes this one a bit sweeter, bringing notes of rich vanilla, slightly astringent coffee, milk chocolate, and almond

A medium silky body pairs with gentle carbonation for a smooth slow sipper. The finish is mostly dry, due to the roasty character of the coffee

1180,Milk Stout,3.83,"I had this beer poured from draft into a shaker pint. Flat dark brown color with good head and lacing. Smell and taste of milk chocolate. Smokey, earthy and very easy to drink. Nice feel for the style. 

Actually surprised I had not reviewed before."
1181,Milk Stout,3.86,"12oz bottle pours a very deep brown-black color with a small cap of dark tan-colored head that recede to a thick ring around the edge of the glass while leaving a small amount of lacing. Smells of dark, roasted malts and 
rich chocolate. Taste is very rich on roasted and charred malt notes, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and coffee with a hint of caramel, toffee, and dark fruits. The flavor is very robust and deep with a noticeable but by no means overpowering sweetness and a slightly astringent, burnt bitterness to close. Full-bodied with a very luxurious smooth (almost syrupy) mouthfeel and subtle carbonation.

This was a very tasty and well-balanced milk stout. Definitely not overly bitter like many American stouts, nor overwhelmingly sweet like many milk stouts. Have had this beer before and will certainly buy again."
1182,Milk Stout,4.26,
1183,Milk Stout,4.01,"Pours into my Guinness glass quite dark. Brown-black with a thin ring, not really a head. 

I can’t smell anything. (Bad air these days.)

Tastes sweet. Almost like cola. But nicely dark-beer roasty. The alcohol isn’t very noticeable. Malty. No bitterness for me. 

Feels thin and light. Lightly carbonated. 

Overall, pretty good. Better as it warms."
1184,Milk Stout,4.11,"440ml Can - Pours black with a 1.5 finger cream head with decent retention. Onthe nose it's fairly sweet with a touch of coffee. Up front, it tastes of roasted malted barley and coffee followed by a hint of dark chocolate (with a very subtle bitterness) and vanilla. Overall, it's very sweet and enjoyable."
1185,Milk Stout,4.04,"Pouring straight into a snifter - minimal head appearing.
Aromas of sweet milk chocolate, coffee, molasses and malts.
Definitely tastes as advertised but isn't as sweet as one expects. Getting malts/molasses upfront followed by coffee and a nice roasty coffee ending.
Feel is so smooth due to the nitrogen, easy to sip, can't taste that 6% at all in this.
I tried this in the beginning stages of trying stouts but can decipher it a lot better and have to say this is still a good treat to have. Try this if your beginning to try stouts and you'll love it."

1187,Milk Stout,4.15,"404ml can served cold into a pint glass. LCBO purchase for around $4 CDN,

Appearance - dark brown color, close to a finger of dense, fluffy tan head. Great staying power.

Smell - Lots of dark chocolate a hint of raisins and some coffee backing everything up. Good intensity.

Taste - Semi sweet chocolate with some coffee in the aftertaste. I get Glosette Raisins mid sip. Pretty delicious stuff, mildly bitter with nice sweet centre.

Mouthfeel - Medium full bodied and very creamy.

Overall - An excellent milk stout, one of the very best that is widely available. Glad to have finally tried now that a batch has come to Ontario."

1190,Milk Stout,4.09,"Poured from a 12oz bottle best by 02/05/2023

On the pour one finger of fine tan head formed then recedes to a decent covering and ring that leaves nice lacing, but continues dissipating. Body is a solid black even up to light, I wish there was a bit more head though.

Aroma is dark and smooth. Like a better, sweeter, and ever so slightly fruitier guiness. Dark chocolate with a hint of roast, verging on coffee with some sweet malty notes make up this one. Slight hops are present but they blend in nicely and are mostly bittering.

Taste follows the aroma with even more roasty almost bitter malts that are quickly balanced by a molasses dark chocolate sweetness. The roast comes out even more in the finish with true and smooth roasty barley making up the aftertaste, retaining some sweetness.

Feel is laid back, smooth, and easy drinking, but still has that cozy ""vibe"" that a good stout should bring. Not too thick or syrupy but still quite full. Quite attenuated despite the sweetness and is almost dry bit not quite with a slight mouthcoating maltiness.

Overall this was exactly what I was looking for. For a slightly chilly early fall night, after drinking too many lagers, a nice dark ale was in order, but I didn't want too many hops or to go too heavy. This is close to refreshing but has a laid back armchair vibe to it as well. Versatile, refreshing, and roasty."

Taste: Like a mocha coffee, sweet, this is one of the best tasting beers. But he warned, it’s very sweet

Feel: Lingers a bit too long imo, but still very nice

Overall: This is a damn good stout. I’m so glad my local liquor store has this. Highly recommend."

1194,Milk Stout,4.07,"I poured a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. A one inch head melted into a thin sheet within minutes, but still provided moderate lacing. The aroma is quite pleasant. chocolate, roasted barley, coffee, milk, and a vanilla-like sweetness prevail. The resultant effect bears a faint barrel-aged resemblance. The taste is about what you expect from the nose. The roasted barley blends well with moderate hops, and the milk sweetens the chocolatey stout. I expected a stickier consistency, but the mouthfeel is nicely balanced... the taste and feel is quite clean and refreshing, compared to a typical stout. I find Left Hand Milk Stout a compelling choice among dark, sweet stouts on the market, and The 6% ABV is right on target for what I desired from this brew."

1215,Oatmeal Stout,4.28,"Poured from a 12-oz. bottle into a pint glass.

Appearance: Nearly black, with a very large tan head that required a gradual pour to keep it from overflowing the glass. The head dissipated gradually, leaving moderate lacing.

Nose: A sweet, pleasant mixture of caramel and dried fruit, with slight alcohol.

Mouthfeel: Moderately heavy, smooth, slight carbonation.

Attack: Sweetness, followed by dark roast.

Finish: Slight bitterness from the roast.

Overall: Highly drinkable, true to the mild character of an English ale; i.e., not near as intense as its American oatmeal stout cousins."
1216,Oatmeal Stout,3.5,"This is at least 5, and maybe as old as 10 years old so I'll adjust ratings as best I can. Pours cola brown with reddish tinges. Minimal head, possibly a byproduct of the age.

1217,Oatmeal Stout,4.12,"Appearance: Pours a completely dark, jet black color with a massive, foamy, and heavy tan head that lingers. SRM of 24. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong aromas of bittersweet cocoa, English cream, some coffee roast upfront. Bitter English cocoa overpowers. (4.00) 

Flavor: Strong flavors of milk chocolate upfront that evolves into a bittersweet English cocoa and cream flavor. Mixes with some coffee roast and milk in the middle. Some hazelnut and English cream linger off the end. Creamy oatmeal malt body throughout. Malty, mildly sweet. (4.00) 

Feel: Medium-bodied, strong carbonation. Full, creamy, and very smooth. (4.50)

Overall: Not a huge fan of the style, but if anyone does it right, it's right here. Pours beautifully. Classic English bittersweet aromas. The malts come through in the flavor for smooth, yet bittersweet, chocolate and oatmeal. Then a perfectly smooth and creamy malt body. All-around one of the best oatmeal stouts. (Rating: 4.12)"
1218,Oatmeal Stout,4.86,"Oh! Hello there, you handsome gentleman...

First encounter with a stout, and it did not disappoint. Picked up a 550 mL bottle at my neighborhood boozitarium. Poured into a clean glass. 

Looks perfectly black on pour, with a thick head, the color of fresh cream. Head dissipated fairly quickly, leaving a milky halo, and delicate eggshell lacing. Only at the barest edges, when drinking, could enough light pass to show a trace of mahogany. 

Smell was coffee and dark chocolate. Taste followed suit–strong coffee and bitter chocolate, with just a hint of brown bread, lurking in the wings. Feel was silky-smooth. 

I'm a fan."

Clear and saddle brown with ruby hues and a two finger manila colored head. The foam is persistent, fairly dense and leaves a little lace. A lively glass of beer.

The nose is malty, with bread, caramel and dried fruit aromas over lesser milky lactose and mineral notes. Less malty and sweet than expected the taste is overall sharp with a woody hop finish. There is Caramel and chocolate malt flavor but bread isn't coming through. Carbonation is medium-high but the medium-weight body is soft and creamy.

1242,Black Chocolate Stout,4.75,Excellent Stout!
1243,Black Chocolate Stout,3.85,"Allowed to acclimate to room temperature for 18 minutes and poured into a snifter.

Pours an incredibly dark brown with equally dark brown hints around the edges, and a 1.5 finger dark tan head.

Initial aroma is a hint of black licorice, followed by Dutch processed cocoa powder, I think there's some raisin in there. I might get a tiny hint of smoke and oak, but I might be hallucinating.

Initial taste is bold and powerful, perhaps a small hint of licorice but otherwise just a big and slightly overwhelming experience to take a large sip. It's quickly followed by bitter Dutch cocoa taste across the middle, back, and sides of the tongue in the middle and aftertaste. I get some bitterness not from the chocolate but from the beer itself as well. Tasting it again after, I realize that in the initial taste it's the alcohol I'm tasting, followed by the licorice, then the cocoa and bitterness. As I get through it I taste a little raspberry, but only in the aftertaste, and only when sipping very small amounts, it's a much welcomed note with the chocolate. Additionally, as I get towards the end the alcohol becomes more noticable in both aroma and taste. At the end I thought the alcohol tasted similar to that of vodka burn and made me think of hass avocado skin and the color olive drab. I know that doesn't make sense, sorry.

The mouthfeel is nice, not exactly velvet smooth but it is definitely smooth. It glides over the tongue easily. Oily and slick, in a good way, if that makes sense.

This is something I could imagine myself sipping slowly with my legs crossed, wearing a nice jacket and having a discussion with someone in a nice living room.

May buy again but not terribly likely, overall a good beer that I enjoyed but did not adore and I think I'm satisfied with drinking once."
1244,Black Chocolate Stout,3.97,"This is a yearly purchase for me, and it’s been interesting to note the slight variation with each release. 
As always, this is a great looking stout. Black with some brown edging, tan head with decent retention. Getting some char, molasses, and fig in the aroma, along with a dark chocolate backbone. The taste surprised me, however. I can still remember the utter shock I had many, many years ago when I found out that this beer DOES NOT ACTUALLY CONTAIN CHOCOLATE. It was an eye-opening experience to see what could be accomplished through malt selection and high-level brewing technique. This year’s release, however, has a super roasty, almost burnt, quality. The chocolate also seems much more like a super dark, bitter (85% cacao) version, rather than the smoother, fudgier flavor I’m used to. It’s alright on the way down, but the finish & aftertaste are harsh. A bit of a letdown compared to prior years, but still decent."

1247,Black Chocolate Stout,2.46,I didn’t taste much chocolate. Quite bitter. Disappointing.
1248,Black Chocolate Stout,4.15,"I've been enjoying BBCS for over 20 years, presented and promoted it for over a decade, offered it in numerous beer tasting events on tap, fresh and in vintage bottles. But this is my 1st review here. It's changed over the years, as will this one if stored properly.
New brown swirly label I don't care for - the classy image of the white on black is missing.
The pour results in a tall, dark tan head of sticky foam with good persistence and specks of lace over a jet black liquid. 
The aroma is big and sweet but not bold or overwhelming. Strong treacle and molasses notes mix with bakers chocolate dripped over warm oatmeal, with a splash of tequila.
The flavor is busy - sharp black grain and long boil hop bitterness stab the tongue up front right along with the caramel malt sweetness that adds depth and complexity. Softer hints of drunken cherries and berries, figs and rye bread all blend with the charred grain and sweet toffee stoutness.
Body is BIG and alcohol doesn't hide well even in the deep, warm stout flavors.
The finish is long and bitter, grassy hops, wet leather and black coffee.
Still a winner but in a boring new package/label."

Glass: Tulip Snifter
ABV: 10%
Serving Temp: room temp


Look: 
Black with a 23-finger high creamy dark tan to light brown head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving very good lacing.

Smell: 
Dark roasted malts with a touch of char. Rich semisweet dark chocolate mixed with some milk chocolate notes. A touch of vanilla.

Taste: 
All the aromas are here and dialed up a notch. A black licorice or anise note joins the party about mid-sip. This is followed by light smokey notes and a light touch of char and ash. Some molasses even sneaks in and perhaps a hint of a dark fruit. A mild bitterness then arrives and helps to change the chocolate to a bittersweet variety. The sip finishes lightly bitter, a tad dry, malty, and lighltly chocolatey.

Feel: 
Creamy, silky and viscous. Warmth from the alcohol can be felt. The body is medium.

Overall: 
A very nice Russian Imperial Stout. Great aromas. Great flavors. Enjoyable and easy to drink. I don't detect much bitterness, which must be from the 3 years that I had this beer in the cellar."

Smoke, roast, chocolate, and dark fruit aroma.
Burnt caramel, dark chocolate, and dried fruit.
Heavy bodied, but dry. Lower carbonation.
The one of the few imperial stouts you can rely on being there every year and not changing. FWIW, I once had a 14yo one that had been stored in a fridge and it tasted like ruby port and cocoa."

1261,Alpha King,4.4,"From my review in NBW 138:

Hello all! Let's get this new beer weekend started, shall we?

This one is Three Floyds Alpha King, sent to me by the inestimable @TurkeysDrinkBeer many moons ago, and one that has been begging me to drink it for some time now...

So, onto the review!

....


This beer has sat in my fridge for six months. It came to me, pride beating in simmering waves from its aluminium chest, across the continental USA, leaping the Pacific Ocean and docking, prouder than John Holmes in a ruler factory, at the back of my fridge.

Since that time it has mocked me. Dared me to drink, to partake of its malty, dank body. But I have been iron of will and clear of mind. Other beers have begged attention, required consumption or perched, testily, at the edge of my fridge. This one has waited, and I have been strong.

Today, though. Today is dawned, bright, clear and autumnal. The air is crisper than it should be. Autumn has slid sneakily to my house, bringing weather not yet welcome for months. It is cool, but I wear shorts in stubborn refusal to bow to sensibility. It makes me angry. I am stubborn, and I am steadfast. But as afternoon breaks I am wroth, and this beer is front and centre.

Angrily I pour. This beer has mocked me, but now I call the shots. In response, it flares its fluffy white warning clouds at me. Unperturbed I sit and wait, still and at one with time. 'Ere long it subsides. Meekly, it exposes its dark, caramel-amber coat, easel to its thin, off-white head. Moderate carbonation follows but, King of my liquid domain, I barely acknowledge the elemental offering of carbon and oxygen. No ritual obeisance will slake my thirst. [L: 4.25]

I offer my nose as the beer, unbowed by curt dismissal of its visual defences, throws rich, chewy caramel notes at me. I rebuff the scent, but It follows with a volley of umami-laced, soy background notes. I pause. Hark, my nasal messenger, do I detect the glory of the titanic pale ales of my spotted craft beer youth? My first stumble, the first scintilla of doubt. Does this bear the ghosts of the pale ales of yesteryear? If so, can I stand before its glory? [S: 4.25]

I regain my chest-forward, arrogant composure. The taste will not mirror the nose. Without a doubt, a tropical, umbrella-bedecked fruit tingle lies in ambush beneath the olfactory assault I have endured. Beer of 2023 can not follow malty talk with commensurate walk. But I am mistaken: taste mirrors the nose, with rich, tangy, chewy caramel and toffee. In backup are deep umami malt notes that envision unearthed deep soil and the bugs that huddle within. It follows with moderate, danky retronasal bitterness sitting at the back of my tongue, building and building before turning back into a long, tangy, caramel finish. This is no tropical fruit bomb! I am bereft of defence to this sorcerous beer! I twist and turn, refusing to partake, but am trapped in this beer's embrace! And it knows it. It knows, Lord it knows. I must take more. I am slave to this delicious throwback to malty pale ale goodness. [T: 4.5]

It refuses to let up. It throws a smooth and full mouthfeel at me, as though nought but an afterthought. It waves away my loving embrace of its carbonation, previously dismissed like so much unwanted chaff. This beer knows better, and it knows how to play its cards. It is harmony, yet it has broken mine. [M: 4.25]

This beer has sat in my fridge for six months, watching, waiting. It pounced when I, suffused with arrogance, sought to bring it to its barley-kissed knees. Instead, it reminded me of the power of malty, hoppy goodness. Reminded me that a whole history of beer lies unloved, forgotten in our lust for tropical, sour and pastry highs, discarded as soon as the next sacrifice kneels at the block. This beer has held its own after an improbable journey to my fridge and then beaten my senses back into shape as it taught me a lesson I should not have needed to learn, and will study for time to come. [O: 4.5]

Cheers!

Some malty sweetness on the front which builds to a mixture of toasty flavors and even a bit of nuttiness. Quite smooth and complexity of flavors grow as it warms. Alcohol is present and there is burnt flavor, maybe like a burnt marshmallow, that lingers. The beer never strays to far from its porter base.

Unlike most of Beer Advocate, I actually love American adjunct lagers, so don’t think I’m one of those fedora tipping anti-lager guys, but it really didn’t do anything for me. Extremely watery tasting, I’d much rather just have a Coors, Miller, or Bud’s brother Busch. I do love the red can though, very iconic.

1293,Budweiser,3.06,"I will attempt to cut through the hype and grade on a curve (""for the style""). Drank from a can dated 23DEC23, today is July 7th 2023.

This is a pretty unremarkable beer. Any special malt characteristics are blended out, the grains being blended with 30% rice in the mash. There is a mild hop bitterness on the taste, pretty indistinct on the smell. What smell there is, is dominated by the beechwood chips added during the brewing. That part of the brew is unique and under-appreciated. Heavy carbonation, which is probably good in something so mild.

There is nothing ""Awful"" about this brew - no off-flavors, nothing intensely artificial, no industrial alcohol vibe. Bland and light, but not so much as Bud Light, which takes better to warming. Make sure you drink these ice cold."

So many other choices without an aftertaste like the glass wasn’t fully rinsed after being washed. I never had a good pour of this in a frosted mug or straight from the can. Read other reviews quantifying why it is a “1” across the board. Use this beer as the benchmark of what is 1 star and enjoy something better."

1296,Budweiser,3.0,"Wait for a ridiculously hot day. Put it in the freezer. Go outside and do some work. Get sweaty. Come in. Pound the Budweiser. This is where this beer shines. Other than that, grab some Hamm's, PBR, High Life, etc. They are a much better deal and have more satisfaction, but hey, I got a case for 3 bucks after the rebate."
1297,Budweiser,5.0,The beer of America!
1298,Budweiser,3.76,"Can dated 25JUN23. Bought an pack due to the large rebate deal they are running. Cant recall if ive ever had a Bud, but if so it was decades ago.

Pours a straw gold with a rapidly dissipating white head. Very slight bread malt aroma that is then overtaken by toasted rice. There isn't a lot of flavor but what is there is pretty good: barely-toasted bread, white cracker, and a slight hop bitterness. All the flavors are clean and distinct, without muddling or off flavors. Light bodied with a dry finish.

Rated to style, this is a good beer. I don't drink AALs often, but this is superior to those I have had."
1299,Budweiser,3.25,"12oz can. Date stamping on can bottom is '17JUN23'.
Clear, pale gold colored body. Thin head with the pour, and this is reinforced by rising bubbles. Leaves behind a few scattered spots of lacing.
Aroma is toasted malts (barley and rice) and slight floral hops.
Taste is sweet and slightly fruity. Base of toasted malts, with floral hops. Bitterness is low. Flavor profile is thin.
Medium mouth feel. Clean and crisp finish. Very good carbonation.
Consistent and refreshing but not with a depth of flavors. Keeps the mouth wet for session work."

1301,Punkin Ale,3.5,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Look is burnt orange, tan head falls off to nothing. Smell is pumpkin pie spices, brown sugar. Taste follows with pie spices up front through the sip. Mouthfeel is lighter side of medium, decent carbonation. Overall, a one and done for me, but not bad."
1302,Punkin Ale,4.96,When I smell a beer this delicious and warming I expect to look at a stout. There's some cloudiness but the nose backs it up. I pick up mostly a dry hop flavour. Maybe that's a characteristic of pumpkins that I am not aware of. I was Leary of the beer cos I don't like too many added flavors. But it did everything but disappoint.

Glass: Chalice
ABV: 7% ABV
Serving Temp: 51.6 F


Look: 
Dark orange-tinted copper. Thin off-white fizzy head quickly dissipated to a thin ring-and-islands pattern. Lacing is OK.

Smell: 
Some light (very light) pumpkin aromas but mostly spices. Strong spices. Cinnamon dominates along with ginger and some cloves as well. There is a sugary sweetness underlying these other aromas.

Taste: 
Follows the nose. The sweetness takes on notes of Candi-sugar and really balances out the spice notes. The ginger becomes the dominate spice in the flavor. The pumpkin is far in the background here. Nutmeg can be detected in the aftertaste.

Feel: 
Crisp but also a tad syrupy. The body is medium-light, if that.

Overall: 
I am not a big fan of pumpkin beers, but this is one that I don't mind. Perhaps because the pumpkin flavor and aroma is quite muted. Since I don't drink many pumpkin beers, the spices really do jump out at me."
1308,Punkin Ale,5.0,to me this is basically the perfect beer
1309,Punkin Ale,3.81,"Pours a pumpkiny orange color with a retentive head.

Taste is of pumpkin, and sweet malts.

Very decent. Not very pumpkin heavy.i like it."
1310,Punkin Ale,3.94,Overall a very good pumpkin beer. Can taste the spices and brown sugar but not overpowering like some pumpkin beers. Will buy the beer again though a little pricey in the midwest.

1323,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.21,"Pours out of the bottle a deep brown color with a finger of head and mild retention. Smells like cocoa, roasted malts, and coffee. Tastes slightly bitter to begin but then gets taken by the dry chocolate flavor. Nice inoffensive carbonation that provides a nice robust mouthfeel. Really nice."
1324,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.76,"One of the best beers I have ever had. Such a great look, the feel is so smooth and easy to drink. The taste is bitter like black coffee but makes sure you feel great drinking it. It is a VERY good beer"
1325,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.53,"Pours from a bottle into a Guinness glass dark brown-black, like Coca-cola. Tan head, maybe an inch, dissolves but doesn’t disappear. (Like a relationship that goes on after the thrill is gone.)

I can’t smell much (bad air in the 513). Floral-y with some alcohol smell. 

Tastes GOOD. Dark. Bitter like dark and burnt and broodingly regretful, like the remnants of my broken heart, or real (black dark-dark-roast) coffee. Has an aftertaste like Coke, only without the acid. As it warms up, just some hints of caramely-sweet in the aftertaste that aren’t there in front. The sweet stays on my lips. (“If she only…” says my broken heart.)

Feels lighter than it looks. A little carbonated. Drinks fast and easy. I was done with it before I wanted to be. (“Tell me about it,” says my broken heart.)

Overall: a very very good beer. VERY good. Like, my own personal standard for what a dark beer not called Guinness can be."
1326,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.26,"Color: almost black with a thick and creamy head
Smell: dark chocolate and coffee are predominant with some malt and toffee sweetness underneath
Taste: bitter coco and coffee, malt and a tiny bit of sweet peeking through 
Feel: holds up well with good texture and mouthfeel 
Highly drinkable, would recommend"
1327,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.43,
1328,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.79,Excellent beer. Very dark. I love it. Recommend trying it. I found this at Earth Fare got a six pack for $6.99. Has lots of head to it. Definitely can taste the malt and hops in it. Much better than any of those light beers I’ve had.
1329,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.61,
1330,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.45,
1331,Edmund Fitzgerald,4.5,"Pours a clear black/brown with glints of red. On top is a foamy tan head with good lacing. Notes of caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, coffee and herbal hops round out the nose. The flavor is smooth and rich for a brew that is surprisingly light on the palate. Hop flavor and bitterness is subdued and the malt really shines with warm caramel and chocolate flavors. Medium bodied with a crisp finish. Overall, I guess I am a little taken aback as I always thought this was more of a big, robust porter from hearing about it. In reality it is a much more quaffable, session-able take on the style than I always thought. Much like great lake's lagers, the level and complexity of the beers malt flavor is much more than one would typically find. This is a very refined, drinkable, and delicious dark beer. Definitely deserving of being compared to Deschutes Black Butte, Sierra Nevada Porter, and other classics."

Format and age: 12oz bottle gifted, best by April 22, 2023.

Cold chain: somewhat unknown. Transported cold after receiving it and kept in fridge at home.

Impressions: pours very dark brown with red edges and a one-finger tan head. Aromas of chocolate and roast coffee dominate. The taste starts with a big kick of bitter chocolate that sweetens as it lingers in the mouth. Progresses to notes of dark roast coffee and burnt toast with some dark fruit on the finish and aftertaste. As it warms, the dark fruits come out more while the bitter and burnt characteristics recede a bit. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, resulting in a smooth feel.

Overall: a great porter. Great Lakes did a good job keeping the bitterness in check while retaining that quintessential porter profile and making it more thab just a roast bomb. Definitely my favorite since having Everett quite a few years ago now."

1341,DirtWolf,4.91,"Pours with nice foam and golden color. Smells heavenly, hoppy and some citrus. Complex but awesome taste. Smooth and some sweetness at first and awesome hoppiness at the end. Definitely my favorite DIPA."
1342,DirtWolf,4.29,"Poured from a twelve ounce bottle, the body is an orange-brown. Very clear. Fluffy white head that creates a ring at the edge. Good lacing. Nice looking beer. 

Aroma is a light citrus, grass and light pine. A wee note of bread dough. 

Taste follows nose briefly then a nice hop bitterness. The malt, vaguely honey flavored, nicely balances this bite and the swallow dries up smoothly. No sign of the ABV in the taste, but it is most definitely felt. 

Good mouthfeel as the carbonation is solid and the beer is soft on the palate. 

An easy drinking 8.7% beer that I imagine would be fabulous on tap. Catch this one fresh as it is an excellent beer."
1343,DirtWolf,4.04,"Pours a rich, deep gold with ample head. Smells fairly predictable for the style: herbal, hoppy, some citrus perhaps. The flavor is herbal hop smack from the first sip, bitter, the citrus and fruit flavors make their presence as it warms up, decent malt, and of course it packs a wallop but still reasonable at 8.7% This was my go shelf Double IPA for about 2 years but I haven’t seen it out here for several years now and it tastes a little different than I remember but another solid beer from Victory, cheers!"

The body is full, moderate soft carbonation, smooth and very drinkable.

1380,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.41,"Purchased a 2023 bottling in 2023. Poured at cellar temperature into a wine glass as my goblet did not survive a move.

Vigorous head on pour half filled my glass with fluffy, off-white foam like a well-made cappuccino. Excellent retention and it took a long time to settle enough to pour a proper glass. Beer is a ruddy brown with tawny highlights. Some haze and fine carbonation.

Immediate malt on opening, like walking into a bakery. Warm, whole grain type bread. Putting my nose into the glass, my impression is of balance. It's subtle and difficult to pull out specific notes, but I get cherry, a bit of almond, orange peel, and a light mineral aspect. The expected regional notes of banana and clove are present but subdued

Taste is the expected clove and banana, plus brown sugar, cardamom, cream. Back notes of coffee beans and mineral water.

Mouthfeel starts out with a Sprite-like effervescence calming to a velvety, creamy texture from the head.

Drinkability? Yeah, it's drinkable. If you can get ahold of enough of it to have a session, sure, you could do it. But after only one bottle I can already tell I'm starting to miss subtleties that I picked up at the beginning. Much more affordable beers to tie one off with. But for any Beer Advocate, this is a bucket list item worth checking off the list."
1381,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.88,"Pours dark amber into a snifter. Very thin and white head which mostly disappears with a slight film left throughout the consumption.
Smell is complex, fruits spice a bit of malt combine for a wonderful aroma. Slight alcohol vapor helps bring the scents up and out into the air.
Mouth feel ,again, complex. 10.2 abv is there ,but no alcohol burn . Smooth with the spice and fruit finishing without very little aftertaste. Overall a truly world class beer."

1386,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.17,"Drank this is a Belgian beer cafe in Warsaw Old Town a few years ago, so reviewing from memory. It was definitely kind of expensive, but not as expensive as I was expecting. On a cold, snowy, lonely night...it seemed the perfect idea.

It definitely looks as beautiful as any beer I have seen. Deep, dark and mystical. And I remember the aromas being similar...deep and mystical...and complex.

I remember it being mega smooth. My initial impression was that this is much better than Rochefort 8 and 10. Much much better. As I have never been a fan of either. This has much more complexity, and is less creamy...and kind of dark and full of different flavour sensations that are difficult to put into words. However as I am reviewing from memory, I will need to review again when I actually have one with me when I am writing. 

So yes, this is kind of a vague review, but I don't remember liking it more than a mega amazing West Coast IPA, or even a Chouffe IPA. It was kind of like a Chimay Bleu but wth much more complexity. So these ratings are my approximated memories. Ciao"

Actually drank this about a year ago with two friends I was sharing bottles with. We did a side-by-side with St Bernardus Abt 12, long my favorite Quad. Although I've left alone my ridiculous scoring of that one (from around 20yrs ago) as it was an amazing experience for me at the time, this actually was the superior beer. I just score a lot more realistically these days, compared to when I was a NOOB and whose mind had just been blown by my first Quadrupel Ale."
1389,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.75,"Got a chance to try this in Amsterdam from a bar that has a guy drive into Belgium every three weeks to pick up a case from various Trappist breweries. The praise for this beer is well-earned. Probably the finest beer I have ever had, and certainly the best quad, even better than my beloved Abt 12. There is nothing at fault with it. It is a lovely experience. I hope I have a chance to try it again one day."

Its been interesting experiencing them age over time. They are still drinking well, but IMHO I think they peaked after about 3 years.
I did a side by side tasting party in 2019 including beers from all 6 Belgian Trappist Ales (Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Bleue, Rochefort 10, Orval, Achel Brune, Westvleteren 12(St Sixtus Abbey), and others (St Bernardus 12, Leffe Brune, La Trappe Quad). Many of these are excellent, but the Westy 12 was head and shoulders above the rest in terms of overall complexity and quality. I agree with many of the tasting notes posted before and I wouldn't do it justice to try, but I will say if you enjoy the strong quad style do yourself a favor and try one. 

OBTW I had to call and hit about 500 busy tones before finally getting through to a Monk and placing my order in 2017; and I had to go in person to the Abbey to pick them up. I believe they now have a website that you can order for delivery. Check their calendar for times and details."

Stamped on cap “24.10.15”. Served at 53.4 degrees in a hand washed and dried Tripel Karmeliet chalice. The final temperature was 59.7 degrees. 
Appearance – 3.5.
First pour –Deep Amber (SRM 15), clear.
Body – Amber Brown (SRM 18), opaque. Under direct light, same coloration but loaded with precipitate and suspended particles. When rear lite, opaque except amber at the edges.
Head – Average (Maximum 1.5 cm, aggressive center pour), almond, high density and fizzy, receding to neither crown nor cap, just an intermittent bubble ring.
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 4.5 – Roasted malt, dates, and figs, sweet candi sugar, no yeast, no hops. No ethanol (10.2 % ABV as marked on cap) aroma. 
Flavor – 4.5 – Roasted malt, dark fruity, slightly sweet. No hops, no yeast. Weak gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. 
Palate – 3.5 – Medium; lightly creamy initially, thins as it warms; lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4 Not bad but maybe cellared a bit too long. The aroma and flavor are fine, but the appearance and body have suffered."
1399,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.41,"Best by 2014 (month has worn away), so, bottled in 2011. A kind gift from my sister-in-law. Poured from a 330mL bottle into my Westvleteren chalice. 10.2% ABV. Served at 55F.

Chestnut/burnt umber liquid with copper/caramel highlights and a small beige cap receding quickly to a lasting collar. Adequate retention; fine lacing; delicate yet viscous legs.

Lovely rich malty/estery aromatics suggest plum, fig, date, toffee, and an old European cobbler's shop. Weighty yet perfectly integrated and inviting. No perceptible oxidation.

Flavor follows the nose but is joined by a low earthy bitterness and some suggestions of brandy and eucalyptus. Long, linear, medium-dry finish. Rounded and rich with some complex stewed fruit elements. 

Modest carbonation, but holding up well given the age. Slightly thin and quite warming. 

More than the sum of its parts, and still a top tier example of the style, though I look forward to updating this review one day with a fresh bottle."

Here we go, beer number 666. And a 101oz bottle at that. I paid over $100 for this but I think it’s gonna be worth it splitting this thing with my boy. Let’s unlock the mini padlock and pop this baby open!

Pours murky reddish brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

This has definitely lost its' intense hoppiness over time, but this honestly smells great now, like a lightly hoppy barleywine. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet brown sugar, molasses, toasted pecan, earthy hops, caramel, golden raisin, and light toast

Where it was charmingly old in aroma, this is a bit too old and faded in taste. It's not necessarily bad but it's showing significant age. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy hops, fusel alcohol, caramel malt, and light fig. The swallow brings notes of brown sugar, toasted pecan, brown bread, and nutty malt

A medium full body pairs with very mild carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet slightly hot beer. Finishes mostly dry with a mild earthy bitterness

It's not the best beer in the world, but I'm still happy to have gotten this big bottle. I'll have to see how I feel after finishing the big ass bottle"

Look: Deep, dark brown, almost (but not quite) black. Thin chocolate colored head, but more than I expected for a four year old bottle.

Smell: Maple and chocolate and immediately obvious, with noticeable bourbon as well. Little to no coffee.

Taste: The strong maple sweetness and the bourbon are noticeable first. Some chocolate is there, but very little coffee except for some bitterness in the aftertaste. The lack of an overwhelming coffee taste works well here, as it lets the maple and bourbon shine but provides just enough bitterness to offset the maple sweetness.

Feel: Silky and smooth with a moderate bite on the back end. The 11.3% ABV is more noticeable in the feel that the taste. Warmth and a mild sting from the alcohol are both present, but not in overwhelming amounts.

Overall: this is a world-class beer for good reasons. This is my very last bottle, so unless Founders re-releases it in the future I'll just say CBS will forever be one of the absolute best barrel aged stouts I have ever had the pleasure of sampling."

1429,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.62,"Bottled 9.25.19

Poured at about 40° into a tulip glass

Pours a deep coffee brown with a surprising one finger+ mocha colored head. Thin almost sheet like lacing and visible rising carbo. Impressive for this older brew. 4.75

Met with maple as soon as I opened the cap, and it's still the dominant note, though there is some very slight bourbon. 4.5

Big maple and chocolate, just a minor hint of coffee. Touch of char and barrel, maybe slight leather. 4.5

Body is wicked smooth with zero sign of how big and burly this beer is. Slight warming blossom as it went down. 11.3% is non-existent- even halfway through the bottle. Dangerous! 5

Overall a world class stout as it says it is that doesn't need my words, but happily leave them anyway as it was a delight of an experience. Haven't enjoyed this fresh, but 4-year mark is truly excellent. 4.75"

Glass: Snifter
ABV: 11.3%
Serving Temp: room temp


Look: 
Opaque black with a 2+ finger creamy light brown head. The head slowly dissipates to a thick ring and thin cover. Lacing is excellent.

Smell: 
A fairly sweet nose. Semi-sweet chocolate. Some brown sugar and maple syrup. Light notes of vanilla. Faint ones of coffee. A touch of bourbon.

Taste: 
Follows the nose but with the maple and the sweetness much more pronounced. And the bourbon notes. The coffee cannot be noticed until fairly late in the sip. The alcohol is noticeable and provides a bit of a sting at the end along with warmth.

Feel: 
Smooth, silky and mouth-coating. Very noticeable warmth and a sting from the alcohol. The body is medium-full.

Overall: 
A very nice Imperial Stout. Complex. This brew is definitely sweet, which makes it a dessert beer for me.

Just to note - this beer is 2.5 years old. That must have had an effect."

1436,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.33,"2019 bomber, poured at 53° into a Founders Brewing sniffer.
Age said no head, so this pours flat black with just a whisper of beige foam that ghosted out fast.
Awesome room-filling aroma of fresh pulled espresso, a chocolatiers best offering in his shop, quite light bourbon too.
Bold flavor - but god awful sweet - tastes of dark chocolate covered coffee beans, vanilla, maple syrup, a bit of mild tobacco. Finishes short with barrel and maple leaf candy left on the palate. Burp of coffee. Sticky lip.
Thick. Really thick. Almost no carbonation at all.
Overall, this fine elixir would’ve been better served two years ago, rather than letting it sit this long. A beattiful effort nonetheless.,."

1440,Burton Baton,4.37,"Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a tulip glass. Dark copper-amber color, with orange highlights and orange-tinged white head that left some streaky lacing as it subsided. Aroma and flavor are malt forward, with notes of orange popping out. Very boozy, with some oaky barrel astringence. Also tons of hop bitterness. As it warms, notes of dried fruit and dark bread begin to emerge. I'd say this is to be enjoyed more as a fine cordial than as a beer. IOW, a slow sipper."

1454,Burton Baton,3.94,"It smells both like wood and the bright freshness of hops with just a little bread water in the background. 

It tastes very interesting. The wood, sweetness and boozy flavor from the 10 abv remind me of whiskey... not bourbon because there's no smoke. After the whiskey you get bright hops and bitterness.

The mouthfeel is very light with just a little fizz. It finishes with an aftertaste of bitterness with breathy alcohol.

Overall it's very good. I wouldn't describe it as an IPA. It's a beer I can't really categorize. I give it a 4.9 out of 6. I think it would have received over a 5 if it hadn't come right after that insanely good stout."
1455,Burton Baton,4.31,Backlog
1456,Burton Baton,4.57,"Coming back to this after a long time... A real throwback to taste so much malt in a double-IPA, though I know this was a cross between a DIPA and an Old Ale. Back when DIPAs first arrived on the scene, many of them tasted this way-- like a hopped up Barleywine or Old Ale. If I close my eyes it feels like I'm back in 1999-- in a good way. Dogfish was way ahead of the curve in oak-aging a beer like this. Warming caramel and hop notes, with the alcohol well-hidden (as it should be). Hits the spot on a cold night when snow is in the forecast; masterfully done-- glad I revisited this classic."

1463,Supplication,4.49,"Supplication (2023) from Russian River. 12.68 fl oz cork and cage bottle from @2beerdogs in NBS BIF #17. Reviewed 23/06/23 (Review 3127). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Label stamped “BOTTLED ON 020823”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 49.8 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 55.9 degrees F. 
Appearance – 4.25
First pour – Gold (SRM 5), clear.
Body – Deep Gold (SRM 6), chill haze. Under direct light, opaque. When rear lite, chill haze.
Head: Average (Maximum 3.5 cm, aggressive center pour), champagne, high density, quickly diminishing to a 0.5 mm broken ring of bubbles with no cap. 
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 4.5 – Weak cherries and oak. No yeast, no hops. No ethanol (7.75 % ABV according to the label). 
Flavor – 4.5 – Cherry, slightly sour with some tannin. No yeast, no hops. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. No ethanol flavor but pleasant gastric warming. 
Palate – 4.5 – Medium; watery; lively but soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.5 Another excellent brew from RR. Their combo of pediococcus, lactobacillus, brettanomyces and saccharomyces species yields a great tasting mixture of organic acids and other metabolic end products although as the temperature rises, the tannin begins to dominate. Still, quite good!"

1466,Supplication,3.73,"375mL cork-topped bottle, bottled on 020823 (barrel aged 9 to 15 months, pinor noir barrels, with cherries). Served in my new stemless CBC glass. Brillian ruby color with excellent clarity and little head formation. Mild aroma suggests a bit of tartness. Flavor brings on a LOT of that tartness, approaching outright sour, but has a delicious ripe cherry flavor which complements the Brett nicely. Sharp carbonation is suitable here.

If I was more into sours I might find this outstanding. I find it more drinkable than Cerise Cassée, and I really appreciate the balance here. Unfortunately for me it's a balance between sour Brett and sweet cherries, not so much the oak and the brown ale underneath that I'd be more interested in."
1467,Supplication,3.81,
1468,Supplication,4.44,"This pours out copper, a bit of haze, minimal head and no lacing. Nose is a punchy vinegar note, wine barrel and fruit beneath. Flavor is a less aggressive presentation of the nose, with cherry and full red wine elements melding into the strong acidity. The wildness also comes through as a counter to the acidity, putting some earthiness and funk on the back end. Well built and delicious."

1479,Supplication,4.21,"Bottled 7/2/17 and received courtesy of @dimidiata. Fairly clear, amber color coming out of the bottle, settling to a deeper semi-translucent caramel once in the glass. The aroma initially struck me as typical wild brett funk, but upon closer inspection the cherry and wine barrel notes revealed themselves in a pleasantly discreet way. 

Taste is wonderfully........different. This is unlike any beer I can recall in recent memory. The cherries are remarkably present after 5 years, but the wine barrel combined with the earthy funk is what's really making this one interesting. Plenty of sweet malts up front, but then the funk emerges mid-palate and into the aftertaste. Fairly full bodied and lightly carbonated. 

Overall, very interesting and very good beer."

1506,Black Butte Porter,4.34,"Pours darkest of browns, nice light brown head; creamy looking, it leaves quickly but a nice persistent film remains; just minor lacing from initial head; nothing after that.

Nose is nicely rich, roast, powdered chocolate, light coffee; all present pretty evenly, a light fruit skin like twang to it.

Taste is so bold yet so drinkable; light dark chocolate with a bite of slightly over-roasted coffee, light sweetness, with a nice ever so slightly piney finish, chocolate lingers in the form of cocoa powder and light roast.

Mouthfeel again, like the rest of this beer, bold at first, but just for an instant; quickly becomes incredibly drinkable and almost light; there is nice little bit of hop bite on a finish that is remarkably dry. Much like the nose hinted at, it has a twang on the finish, light light fruit skin like acidity."

Pours pitch black with a small, wispy toffee colored head. Sporadic lacing. Aroma is coffee and chocolate and figs and alcohol. Mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking. Slightly watered down but wonderful flavor overall. I enjoyed the draft version more and this bottle was a bit of a letdown. Solid beer but plenty better."
1565,Bomb!,4.75,"Look: exceptionally dark brown, almost black. Very thin mocha colored head, minor lacing. 

Smell: very well-mixed chocolate and vanilla fight for dominance. Moderately strong coffee and malt. 

Taste: follows the nose. The chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and malt sweetness are all present. Nothing is overpowering. No real taste of chile peppers until the back end (see feel). 

Feel: rich, silky, velvety, and smooth. Low carbonation as expected given the style and the 13% abv. Warmth from the alcohol during and after swallow. Tingling spice on the tongue (from the chile peppers) long after the swallow. 

Overall: one of the best - and possibly THE best - adjunct imperial stout I have ever had the fortune of trying. Exquisitely well-balanced flavors."

Look- Black, opaque, plentiful visible particulate at the edges, dark brown frothy head, zero head retention, below average lacing (but coats glass wall).

Smell- Cacao, coffee, chili pepper, vanilla, high strength of scent.

Taste- Cacao, coffee, chili pepper at finish, moderately bitter, high strength of flavor.

Feel- Between medium and full body, well below average carbonation, mildly spicy, moderately mouth warming, mildly mouth coating, moderately bitter, syrup like.

Overall- Black in color with visible particulate at the edges and zero head retention. Bouquet was high in strength with a great mix of cacao, coffee and chili pepper. Taste was also high in strength with the same wonderful flavor profile. Feel was between medium and full bodied with mild spiciness and moderate mouth warming ability. Overall this was a really great beer that provided an excellent drinking experience. The only critique I had was that the carbonation was noticeably weak, but that could have been a one-off."
1575,Bomb!,4.25,
1576,Bomb!,4.22,"From a 12oz bottle, dated 03/17/22. Served in a tulip.

Pours a slightly thick-appearing chestnut-black with a finger of dense mocha foam. The head holds up for thirty seconds or so - actually pretty good considering the abv - leaving a scant collar and a barely rousable spattering of super-slippery lacing.

Nose is rich and chocolatey. Aromas of milk chocolate and chilis. 

Taste is candy bar-like, mildly sweet, nutty and lightly roasted. Sweetened coffee taste is present but dominated by Lindt-type milk chocolate at the beginning, then by ancho chili and vanilla on the back end. Tasting demerara sugar, mocha java, ancho chili and vanilla. There’s a subtle nutty, peanut buttery character at the end and into the aftertaste.

Feel is smooth and creamy, not much more than medium bodied I think, but further lightened by the ample, fine carbonation. It’s a notably clean mouthfeel considering the style, the abv, and the various adjuncts.

Overall, nice. Clean-drinking and tasty, only lightly sweet and not at all syrupy. At least comparable to many of the finer imperial stouts I’ve met but perhaps at a more regrettably unattractive relative price point."
1577,Bomb!,4.65,"L: Thick motor oil poured from a 12oz bottle into a sniffer - slight head risen. No light shining through this one.
S: Big coffee aromas followed by chocolate, vanilla and a slight spicy smell to it. Reminds me of a Ducato imperial stout that was made with chili peppers.
T: Ohhh wow, Definitely an AMAZING beer!! Huge spicy chili chocolate up front followed by a easy vanilla ride to the coffee profile in the after taste. Man oh man this one is top 5 in the books.
F: Spicy, acidic, heavy bodied beer - not to carbonated. Easy to drink, can't taste the alcohol at all.
O: This reminds me of a similar imperial stout made with spices that resemble chili peppers. This for me is a barrel aged version of Ducato Verdi Imperial Stout but with different characteristics that make it much more complex such as a spicy bakers chocolate upfront taste followed by a smooth vanilla ride to the end where the coffee after taste lingers. Very well done and a solid A+ for me."
1578,Bomb!,4.25,"Appearance - Dark mahogany body with tan head

Smell - chocolate, fudge, chili pepper

Taste - Chocolate, fudge, mocha, vanilla, chili pepper

Mouthfeel - Medium Bodied, full carbonation, chocolaty upfront, slight heat from the pepper in the middle, fudgy on the finish, no hint of booze at this ABV

Overall - this is a good beer, great sipping for those chilly nights, not quite worth the price of admission (>$10), which I did not pay"

1580,Expedition Stout,4.59,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this one yet. Had at least 10 bottles of this over the past few years. Bottled 9/14/21. Just about two years old. A perfect aging. 

The pour yields a thin line of dark brown foam. It quickly fades, leaving a ring around the glass. 

Nose is right down the middle Russian Imperial material. Roasted malt brings notes of dark chocolate, dark fruits, brown sugar, and the slightest bit of soy sauce. You can tell that this brew will be incredibly animated just from a first glance. 

Taste follows through, but bringing even more. Roasted malt, smokiness, dark chocolate, dark fruit, slight caramel, brown sugar or perhaps even black strap molasses. Wonderful stuff. The bitterness on this one is just perfect. Reaching high points, but never overwhelming or obtrusive. The flavors still fly true, almost urged onward by the bitterness, them working in tandem. Everything working together to create the final product.

Mouthfeel is fullbodied, almost pillowy. Has heft and density to it with just the slightest bit of cloying. Very mild carbonation. The mouthfeel delivers the flavor perfectly. 

Overall this is easily one of the best Russian Imperials you can buy. In eternal cellared stout, beer fridge, staple material along the likes of Sierra Nevada's Barrel Aged Narwhal, Old Rasputin, and Founders Imperial Stout. A brew that demands respect."
1581,Expedition Stout,4.43,"12 oz bottle into a snifter. Deep dark brew, fine proud brownish foam.
Aroma of cafe Cubano, dark roast malt, stone fruits.
Taste hits like lightning with notes of dark chocolate, prune, coffee, and a pronounced bitterness, all in perfect harmony. Great long and chewy finish, the hoppy bitterness last to exit.
Full body mouthfeel. Medium carbonation.
Overall, a superb, well made, classic RIS for the people!"
1582,Expedition Stout,4.75,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle, dated 9/7/22, ""Shelf Life — Unlimited,"" and purchased at the brewery last month, into a stout glass.

Appearance: Opaque/black, with a massive dark tan head that lingered a very long time and left beautiful lacing.

Nose: Very complex: dark roast, a bit of coffee, sweet dried fruit, brown sugar -- oh, my!

Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy.

Attack: Bitter, as you would expect from an RIS — but absolutely well-balanced and very smooth — deep dark roast, chocolate, dark fruit sweetness, a little coffee.

Finish: The bitterness from the dark roast as well as from some hops lingers, and lingers very nicely.

Overall: There's a lot going on in this fantastic RIS; few beers are this well balanced. Certainly not a session beer at 10.5% ABV, but more drinkable than just a sipper. I'm having a hard time coming up with anything I don't like about this beer. I understand that my rating numbers are very high for this beer — and higher than the average of other raters; I truly think it's worth these scores."

Canned 2021 (2 years ago)

Appearance: Pours a completely black, color with a moderate and thick dark tan head. SRM of 24. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong and smooth aromas of rich dark chocolate, somewhat bittersweet with a sweet bourbon, bread, and caramel flavor. (4.00) 

Flavor: Dark, smooth, rich and sweet flavors of dark chocolate, rich bread, caramel, strudel, some scotch and bourbon to finishes malty. Minimal roast. (4.25)

Compared to Great Lakes Blackout Stout 2/2023: Pours similar, darker head. Similar aromas. More thick and heavy chocolate with malt complexity of bread pudding and caramel. Less coffee and roastedness. Heavier and sweeter.

Overall: Tried this one a few times and unfortunately my review was accidentally deleted so cannot look back on previous reviews. Now I'm drinking this one from 2021 in 2023 so aged a couple of years. It's rich, heavy, and thick. Some complexity to the malt flavors of chocolate, dark meat, bread pudding, and caramel.

Bottle marked on back label “Shelf Life – Unlimited” also “PKG 09/20/2022). Served at 53.4 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 56.1 degrees. 
Appearance – 3.
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), nearly opaque.
Body - Ruby Brown (SRM 24), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, opaque but some light penetrates the edges – ruby.
Head – Average (Maximum one cm, aggressive center pour), copper, high density, quickly diminishing to a 0.15 cm crown with a thin, partial cap. 
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 4.5 – Medium roasted malt with light char, and hints of chocolate, no hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.5 – Flavor follows the nose – roasted malt, slightly bitter, no hops, no yeast. No ethanol (10.5 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. Marked gastric warming occurs. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. 
Palate – 4 – Medium, slightly creamy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4 Looks like every other RIS. Flavor is typical for the style, without the coffee notes many RIS have. Aroma is also typical."
1599,Expedition Stout,4.54,Due to ABV split this 12 ozer with my son in law. Dark dark dark in color. Exceptional taste up front and nothing weird on the finish. ABV disguised so well it’s crushable but at your own peril. Will cellar one or two from this sixer. Well priced at 16.00 for six
1600,Hoptimum,3.67,Not the hop bomb I was expecting. Has a annoying malty/sweetness to it that I don’t care for. I was hunting this down for a while and I was let down.
1601,Hoptimum,5.25,

Smell - dank ripe fruit, piney, citrus
Taste - sweet fruit, piney, hoppy, resinous
Feel - medium body, moderate carbonation, highly resinous sticky finish
Overall - This is one hoppy Mutha. A tale of two halves to this gem. She's a bit boozy at first and the juicy fruitiness is more present on the scent and taste. It's like a hoppy, juicy, candy-esque treat. As it breathes and warms, it shifts to the piney, hoppy, resinous flavor with some citrus to balance it out. If you're looking for your hop fix, this is it. Let it warm, sip and enjoy. Ratchet up Blue Oyster Cult and zero in on Godzilla for this monster."

A perfectly drinkable beer. Nice and crisp, but I can't find anything I really love about it. Not much complexity. I can think of many other IPAs I'd rather be drinking.

Somewhat heavy ABV at 11%. One bottle will have you feeling a buzz, so don't have too many of these..."
1607,Hoptimum,4.57,"Look: Poured into snifter. Burnt orange in color with a fluffy beige-colored head.

Smell: Strong notes of citrus fruits - orange in particular. Strong hoppy aromas as well. Very dank but also has a sweetness to it as well that makes for a really pleasant smell.

Taste: Powerful hoppy front, nice bitterness that you’d expect and it really bites down on you. Citrus fruits follow - I’m getting the orange from the nose plus lemon, malts, some barley, and then there’s a really nice bitterness after the baseline taste finishes. All in all it has a very imperial taste to it, and it’s superb.

Feel: Heavy on this one - it’s 11% ABV and tastes / feels imperial. The carbonation is medium but it sits heavy. Take your time with this one and sip it steadily.

Aroma is disappointing., it’s not as mighty as it should be for a huge TIPA.
Taste is a tad confusing; it’s not this big hoppy dank bomb I was expecting / hoping for. The sweetness is annoying. There’s a hint of bitterness trying to surface but the sweet kicks it back down.
Mouth is nicely dense, mid carbonation.

Look: Pours a very pretty copper color. Almost completely clear; just a very faint haze that appeared after I poured the bottom of the can. There was a thick, rocky off-white head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer.

Smell: I definitely smell the grapefruit aroma up front. It smells nice. Other fruity, caramelly, and herbal/vegetal notes but nothing distinctive besides grapefruit. After delving into it, I can detect nice apricot and orange zest aromas.

Taste: It's very tasty. Up front, there's grapefruit flavor with a bit of acidity. The mild, gentle initial grapefruit flavor explodes into an oily, bitter, pithy profile that attacks the sides of the tongue and the back of the palate. The finish is long, piney, resinous, and bitter with lots of grapefruit peel and pith. Eventually, I can detect a pleasant caramel malt sweetness after the bitterness subsides. Even though this beer is so bitter, I feel like there is an element of balance to it because along there's also a lot of caramel malt to help counteract the strong bitterness.

Feel: Medium bodied with an appropriate level of carbonation. Someone oil, slightly chewy mouthfeel.

Overall: This has got to be one of the quintessential West Coast IPAs. I tried regular Sculpin IPA many years ago, and I was utterly unprepared for how bitter it was. This is also very bitter, and I think that my palate has adjusted over the years and now embraces bitterness. This beer requires a palate adjustment for many folks, and that's okay because many folks' palates (and minds) need to be adjusted! It's also nice to see that this beer can hold up to Father Time; at almost four months old, it's still very aromatic and flavorful.

It was served colder than a wheat pale ale should be, but man did it quench my thirst. The beer had an orangish, wheaty look to it and had similar aromas.

Overall a great and very tasty summer wheat beer. More savory than sweet, filling over refreshing, but very good overall. 4.25"

1686,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.65,"12 oz can poured straight from the fridge into a pilsner glass 

Pours a clear yellow gold with a quickly dissipating, 1 finger, sudsy white head, leaving behind minimal lacing and a film of head.

Initial aroma is cereal grainy, bready malt, crisp, and yeasty. It's the classic lager smell, a little in the way of fruity yeasty esters. After agitating I'm hit with a blast of yeast, not quite funk but something in the vein of yogurt bacteria, there's also a high amount of malt.

Initial taste before swallowing is malty sweet, almost fruity. After swallowing I'm met with a large dose of grain and malt flavors, a little tasteless but the taste that is there is good. Relatively high sweetness throughout the whole process.

Mouthfeel is honestly better than I would expect from a 4.8%. it's not spectacular but it's not really thin either. Carbonation is overall mediocre but definitely adds a lot, it fades quickly but rejuvenates impressively upon agitating.

Overall I totally understand why this is revered as a good cheap beer. Like, listen. It's not a great beer, but it's already not bad, and for $1 a can it becomes better. I realize that's not the healthiest way to measure the worth of something, especially alcohol, but I'm not buying in large amounts. It excels for the adjunct lager style, while being inoffensive and extremely easy to drink, if nothing else.

Definitely will purchase again at some point in the future, likely in 6 pack format, and will recommend as a good cheap beer. Will not purchase often, but still."

Clear, pale gold colored body. Thin white, small bubble head. This head is constantly replenished by rising bubbles. Left behind are some scattered spots of lacing.
Aroma of grain and corn malts, very doughy. Has a little floral and earthy hops.
Taste is malt laden - grain and corn, which is slightly sweet. Floral and fruity hops. Quick end to the aftertaste. Touch of sulfur.
Slightly thin for mouth feel, but this might have something to do with the rapid exit of flavors after each sip or quaff. Smooth and crisp finish. Very good carbonation.
Wet and simple profile. Poundable. Does not get in the way of bar activities."
1688,Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.84,"Light clear golden color. Great for hot weather, when you're eating and don't want anything to distract from the flavor, or when you're doing something that you're not thinking about the beer itself like watching sports. Definitely not a craft beer, nothing exciting or interesting about it, but it is not bad for what it is which is a cheap macrobrew. Think of it as a palate cleanser when you get tired of all the high flavor microbrews and then you'll be fine with it."

Then by 2011 there must have been an article about it in Hipster Monthly Magazine, because fedoras began to tip by the millions nationwide for PBR. The beer tastes OKAY, and it’s in the 11 dollar range for a 12pk, which is the new CHEAP for beer. It is the gold standard for a 3 out of 5 beer.

1707,Delirium Tremens,4.03,"11.2 oz bottle acclimated to 56°F and poured into a goblet.

Pours a rich amber/honey gold with a long lasting 1 finger foamy white head, leaving a think ring of lacing.

Initial aroma is clean fruit esters (my brain is saying pear and pineapple but it's very faint and I'm not sure) with a somewhat sterile, clear alcohol smell. Additionally a pepperiness, a light, fresh, light green grassiness, and a light white floral note can be found. Maybe damp hay? I guess that's probably the yeast. After agitating I notice the alcohol comes forward, and a clean and pale maltiness can be found.

Initially before swallowing I get a peppery tingling, may be due to the alcohol, there's also a sweet, vague fruitiness.

After swallowing I'm hit with alcohol upfront, stays at the back corners of the roof and bottom of the mouth and top of the front half and tip of the tongue and reminds me of a fruity brandy, I'm getting specifically pear. I get a malty note I can best describe as damp hay, just like I smelled. The pepperiness I smelled is there too, it seems almost paired up with a dry, somewhat bitter grassiness which differs from the grassiness I smelled. A note of dry white wine reveals itself to me upon getting further in and is now present throughout the whole process. The aftertaste comprises dryness, alcohol burn (which fades), fruity fumes, and that dry white wine taste.

Feel is very smooth, with almost a chew to it. Fuller body than average, genuinely almost a little syrupy. Additionally, the carbonation persists, meaning that I can truly enjoy this one slowly, which is how I drink beer.

Overall it excels. The flavors pair with each other exceedingly well and it exhibits a top display of coherence in beer. The only thing I can think of that I would prefer is a lower ABV, I generally quite enjoy high (and quite high) ABV beers but the alcohol burn in this one is reminiscent of a brandy or other spirit and it's harsh to my tastes. Still, this beer could be renamed delirium tremendous.

Will absolutely buy again at some point, though not often. That's on me though, I love love love Belgian dark ales, but Belgian pales are not my absolute favorite. Otherwise it would be a common purchase. Will be recommending to people for sure."

Aroma: Strong aromas of Belgian bread spice, cloves, yeast, and bread malts. Faint citrus and flower underneath. (4.00)

Flavor: Strong flavors of Belgian bread spice, flower, yeast upfront. It then evolves and shows the alcohol for only a bit before a rich, smooth, and sweet bread malt comes through with some sweet citrus and alcohol warmth to back it up. Finish is smooth, bready, and sweet. (4.00)

Feel: Medium bodied, strong carbonation. Creamy, smooth, shows the alcohol warmth, and sweet. (4.25)

Overall: Not my favorite style in a Belgian Strong as sometimes too heavy and boozy, but this is a good one. Probably the best I've had. Still rich and boozy, but also great Belgian bread spice and sweet citrus flavors with a decently clean mouthfeel. I usually prefer a Saison or Tripel with stronger yeast and spices.

Aroma of biscuit malt, citrus hops, lemon, orange, grapefruit and some dankness. Flavor is biscuit and light dry caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, grapefruit, orange, pine, mild mixed tropical fruit, a little rye; resinous pine and citrus rind finish with great alpha oil bitterness. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. Glad to finally try something from this venerable brewery and I'm glad I started with this. Getting an IPA from the Midwest that has substantial bitterness is a joy in this hazy age and this is one solid IPA. The malt is somewhat old fashioned with good biscuit notes, but the hops are classic NW IPA, which is my favorite profile. Lots going on here and quite enjoyable. This IPA has been off my radar, I'm going to try to snag a Gumball Head next, one of my favorite ale names. Looks, smells and tastes great."
1728,Dreadnaught,4.35,"Pours out of the can a gently hazy deep copper with a nice two finger white head and great retention. Laaaazy bubbles up the side of the glass. Smells piney, resinous, and like ripe citrus. Tastes leans heavier on the pine and resin and hits you a bit with the alcohol. I think on the third sip I was starting to find the malt notes that are advertised on the can. If I'm honest, it's really well done, but the alcohol is a tad bit distracting from the overall flavor, but not enough to bring its score down too bad. It's a robust mouthfeel and is carbonated expertly. Glad I got to try this old school imperial that I've heard was a game changer years ago."

1730,Dreadnaught,4.43,"From a tap, delivered inside a clear pint glass it came. It's beautifully and brightly copper-amber with a very modest off-white head. The aroma, although not pronounced, brings IPA hops and malt. There's a little too much alcohol to taste to keep it from excellence, but the ABV is 9.4, for goodness sake. The malt body is rich and up to carrying the hops and most of the alcohol. As it should be the hops, both citrusy and earthy, dominate the outstanding taste."

Heavy, syrupy bodied keeps this from being drinkable, but otherwise, exemplary"
1733,Dreadnaught,3.79,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $4.89. Canned on 3/17/23, so this is five weeks and a day old.

Look: It pours out a very nice light orange amber color with very tiny floaties. The two fingers of rocky, beige-colored head slowly dissipated. Looks like a nice Imperial IPA.

Smell: It smells super piney along with a bit of citrus notes. I get orange peel and some pepper. There's also some sweet malt notes and some boozy bubble gum notes. For a beer that is this big, the nose is underwhelming.

Taste: This is a huge Imperial IPA. At 9.4% ABV, it really does not taste nearly as strong as it is. It's dangerously drinkable and it's actually somewhat balanced. Up front, it's malty and sweet for a very short time before the hop bitterness takes over. The finish is very bitter and earthy with huge pine notes and grapefruit peel and it lingers super long. Eventually, orange peel and caramel/crystal notes come forward after the bitter hop resins fade from the front of the palate. After pouring the bottom of the can, the body improved a bit but the taste also became slightly chalkier.

Feel: It's medium plus bodied with a nice chewy, slick, and slightly oily mouthfeel.

Overall: This is definitely a solid Imperial IPA. I can appreciate this beer, but it's not really my personal preference to go seeking this out again. I may have had it many years ago via Beer Trade, but at that time I was just looking to seek out the ""big beers"" that were highly rated and I may not have even had an Imperial IPA before, so it was worth trying again.

S: Light malt sweetness, mild banana, mild fruitiness and mild hops. Fairly mild for a Tripel.

1788,Hennepin,4.12,"Procured in a trade/proxy arrangement with @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drink in October that year.

L: There are orange cordial vibes going on with the presentation of this beer, making my mouth water before I even contemplate putting my nose into the glass. There's no head bar a small rim around the edges. Sediment from the full-bottle pour hangs suspended in the beer, barely ruffled by the few large bubbles of carbonation that dart to the top of the glass. 

S: On the nose, there's a slight yeast note and an indefinable tanginess that hangs in the aroma. 

T: The taste has sweet orange, sherbety orange pith and yeast - that orange note probably accounting for the tanginess I picked up on the nose. The orange is followed by a musty, slightly aniseed note. It's probably the coriander and whatever bird-of-paradise grain is. Or perhaps it's the last vestiges of the yeast playing with those spices. Regardless, it's extremely tasty and definitely compels a second mouthful straight after the first. 

m: On the tongue, there's almost a sherbety quality to the beer, but it's followed by a spritzy snap after the swallow, and it dries things out quickly after that point. 4.25

O: This beer comes together extremely well. The taste is somewhat unique and the mouthfeel and nose only add to that impression. I wonder if I could drink more than one of these, though, as I can imagine palate fatigue setting in quickly with such a sweet, sherbety beer. It treads this side of the cloyingly sweet line well, but volume could push it over. Based on drinking one rather than several, however, it stands up very well.

There is a very little bit of biscuit malt flavor to go along with it, too.

It's pretty cool how pure and well-executed this is. It deserves to be a classic, but not legendary. Then again, I can't even imagine what it would have been like to drink an IPA in 1994."
1810,Blind Pig,4.31,"Look - clear and gold in color, white soapy head, lacing was spotty
Smell - citrusy, piney, grapefruit, woody aromatic
Taste - hoppy grapefruit, piney, spicy, fruity
Feel - medium light body, medium carbonation, crisp, dry with a light bitter finish
Overall - Tasty brew. It was even better as it warmed up a bit. The citrusy and fruity flavors came thru even more. Although this brew was a bit light in the body, the hoppy grapefruit, piney notes added balance and a nice lingering bitterness. I paired her up with ""Pigs (Three Different Ones)"" by Pink Floyd for ultimate satisfaction."

Bright, golden yellow with a brighter, white head of sticky foam.
Good staying power and lacing.
Aroma is clean and softly sweet, hints of lemon and sugar dusted pineapple, this beer smiles and invites you in politely.
Flavor is balanced mix of lager-like malt and white pepper hop bite.
Long and mellow hop character in balance with the mild sweet roll flavors and stewed fruit notes with just a hint of alcohol.
Clean, balanced and well made is the best way to describe this very session-able but slightly boring big beer."
1832,Sip Of Sunshine,4.51,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time and leaving a moderate sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is very strong of a sweet grapefruit and tangerine smell mixed with notes of papaya and some herb. There is also a rather strong peach and apricot smell, mixed with some lighter smells of pear and biscuit malt.
Taste – The taste begins with a nice smooth tangerine and bready malt flavor mixed with the grapefruit hop that was in the nose. There is a touch of herbal and pine hop at the start as well, but these are very light in comparison to the grapefruit hop flavor. Other flavors of a light honeydew melon and a decent showing of mango and papaya are there as well, with the ladder fruit getting more intense as the taste advances. A light floral hop and a bit of grain develop at the very end, leaving one with a smooth and rather citrus strong taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the lighter and thinner side for a 8 % abv brew, with a moderate carbonation. For the big citrus and fruit flavors the feel is quite nice, making for a nice and dangerously easy sipper.
Overall – A very pleasant drinking, citrus forward, and highly flavorful IPA. A quite well crafted and very tasty brew."

1834,Sip Of Sunshine,4.4,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a three finger off-white head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and tropical fruit hops, orange, pineapple and mixed tropical fruit and a little pine. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus, tropical fruit an piney hops, grapefruit and orange rind, pine needles, mild mixed tropical fruit and some dankness. A somewhat different piney and citrus rind flavor develops in the finish with great aggressive bitterness. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. I guess with the market domination of hazy NE style IPAs out here in the West, I kinda thought the East Coast would be a wasteland of hazies. I've been lucky enough to get several fine IPAs from out East and I'm now convinced that good old non-hazies are available there too. This is a fine example. Not quite a West Coast profile, but lots of the citrus and pine I crave. Lots of herbal hop flavor. I am especially happy about the flavor change about mid-taste, where strong pine takes over from the citrus and fruit, but a somewhat different, mixed fruit note is revealed behind the almost resinous pine. Appropriately named,this is a bright, cheerful IPA I'd love to drink again."

1844,Lunch,4.68,"Exceptionally delicious. Flies under radar aromatically. Upon sipping, flourishes of peach, pine, clementine, guava, passionfruit, deep herbal zing. Massive green flood of vegetal garden. Aggressive allium zing, cleaned up with deep, crisp malt. The hops explode for days and days and days. Ends nice and wet letting you sop up and savor the sugary abundance of lupulins and choice grain and hop oils. Uniquely superb modern “india pale ale” in its potency at only 7% abv.” A sort of heady toppa / Pliny contender for me. Exquisite stuff! Thank you."

1851,Lunch,4.06,"Bought from a Whole Foods in Munster, IN. The bottled date says April 23, 2023, putting it right on the edge of the freshness date, but I was curious. Poured from the 1 pint 9 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. The beer is a pure orange color topped with a foamy off white head that leaves chunky lacing on the glass. Some sediment within.

Smell: A great, balanced, refreshing smell. Citrus and floral. Grapefruit and honey. Caramel malt. Sweet but in a tropical way, not sugary. Some pine balances things out. Nice.

Taste: Citrus rind and some resin balanced by a slight honey sweetness and caramel malt. Bright throughout. Finishes surprisingly balanced and clean. Slight pine remains.

Overall: Super refreshing and drinkable. I would pick this out again with no hesitation. I really want to try this again when fresher, as I feel like some of the character has already mellowed out a bit. But still tasty."

1853,Lunch,4.28,"Canned 4/3/23 (4 months ago)

Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy (60% clarity) bright and vibrant, deep orange color with a strong and thick white head that lingers. SRM of 10. (4.50)

Aroma: Strong aromas of grapefruit citrus, nectarines, oranges, and pine. A little bit of tropical notes as well. Smooth malts underneath. (4.00) 

Flavor: Strong flavors of oranges, nectarines, grapefruits. Pine and yeast follow with a smooth caramel malt body for a soft balance. Some bitterness from the pine dances for a minute before a smooth and slightly sweet finish. (4.25) 

Feel: Medium to heavier bodied, strong carbonation and yeast. Strong malt profile, but not overly sweet. Hides the booze completely. (4.50)

Overall: Currently ranked as the #11 on BeerAdvocate, I was finally able to pick this up. Brewed since 2011. Beautiful pour. The aromas and flavors are subtle, yet complex. Shines in the mouthfeel as it has that bitter west-coast flavor, but also a smooth malt body. No trace of booze or any hop burn here. A delicately balanced, wonderful IPA. (Rating: 4.28)"

1856,Lunch,4.46,"500 mL bottle into a stemmed pint glass

Man, I love these WC/hazy hybrids when done right. Toppling Goliath, 3F’s come to mind. Some of my favorite breweries out here in SoCal just left some of their coveted WC styles unfiltered, which were tasty in themselves, but not quite the same as this. And Modern Times kind of cut their teeth on the style, but their IPA’s have gotten redundant, imo. 

Anyway, this beer is a knockout…crisp and citrusy with a subtly juicy finish. I’d say if you didn’t look at it, you’d guess it’s more of a West Coast style, with that grassy/piney thing going on, but it’s definitely unfiltered and hazy in appearance."

Flavors follow the nose nicely with dark bakers cocoa, char, coffee, and floral as
well as pine touched hops on the rear. Nice mouth feel; medium full body, smooth,
lightly creamy, and finishing with a char and bitter malt note balanced by strong
hops.

1872,Storm King,3.94,"Victory Storm King is a well balanced stout, with elements of malt, roasted malt, and hoppy bitterness. The 9.1% alcohol content is well hidden. The flavor is more assertive than a Guinness Stout Nitro. I recently tasted a Carlow O'Hara Stout that was more aggressively flavored than Storm King, even having half the alcohol content. All things being equal, I'd prefer to drink two of the O'Haras than just one Storm King."

1875,Storm King,4.37,"Label says best by Oct 22, 2022. Interesting since an imperial stout can get better with age.
reviews i've read lead me to expect something different in the nose, but the sweet, dark candy smell, betrays nothing about this being any different from any other Impy stout. The opaque blackness topped with a thin, offwhite foam also seem normal. The only deviation is the additional bitterness of the hops, which only appear to me in the taste, rather than in the smell. Its noticably drier than I'd expect, and the alcohol is well hidden. Hops dominate later in the taste. 
Its a nice change, but, to me, a minor flourish rather than a major deviation from the style. The mouthfeel is light, but chewy. Overall, very nice, and at a comfortable price point for an imperial stout."

1877,Storm King,4.13,"Pours black with a nice light brown head. Not much retention but a nice thin layer of creamy light brown persists. 

Citrus hops, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and dark roast black coffee.

In the middle I get some bitterness from the hops, more fruit, and a cocoa powder flavor. Finish is hoppy, cocoa powder, and coffee. Very balanced between sweet and bitter. Mouth feel is medium-full, rather soft and creamy even with a tight carbonation present. The alcohol is hidden pretty well. Overall, I'm glad they brought this back.

Pours a dark brown like the color of the glass bottle it came in, yet looks basically black poured into a glass. Has a head you would expect from a darker beer like this…the head dissipated but still left a thin lingering layer…the lacing is wonderful. The 8.7% ABV is extremely well-hidden in this brew. Honestly—this does leave your tongue longing for more sip after sip, with the melody of flavors. I’m about 2/3 done with this 1 pt 6 oz bottle and I have no idea why I’m already feeling buzzed. Nice work on a unique brew, Stone. Try it while you can as it is a limited re-release."

1900,Stella Artois,3.12,"22 oz bottle acclimated to 40°F and poured into a footed pilsner glass.

Pours a clear, slightly vibrant yellow gold, with a 1.5 finger sudsy head, lasting a decent while and leaving about average lacing.

Initial aroma is marijuana with cumin oddly enough. Smells yeasty and almost salty but really boring else noticable. After agitating I smell a clear bread smell.

Initial taste before swallowing is skunky with a mellow sweet yeasty background. After swallowing I get a big hit of breadiness I quite like, which dwindles into the aftertaste but remains. Appearing somewhere in the middle is a hop presence you'd expect from a lager, not strong, herby, being slightly dry and olive green, and a little spicy/peppery and floral. Through the entire process exists that skunkiness and it just isn't pleasant. It's more bitter than I would expect, but not enough to slow down my process.

Mouthfeel is actually impressive, definitely has enough body to it to feel substantial. I don't think I'd say creamy but there's a little richness, seems as though it glides.

Overall It's about where I'd expect, solid but not great. I must say I was surprised how skinny it was, which really subtracted from the experience, but the other flavors present were nice. The mouthfeel was pleasant and made it easy to drink where the flavor put me off a little, nice average beer I'd say.

Not likely to buy again but I could be convinced if it's cheap, don't remember how much I paid for it."
1901,Stella Artois,3.91,Don't be fooled by its look or it's smell (nothing extraordinary there). The canned version of this beer is remarkably smooth without being tasteless. It pairs great with a meal. In my opinion it's a solid beer for its price.

Taste: it has a well balanced taste with a variety of flavors. It tastes hoppy, grassy, flowery, and even a bit Smokey. 

Feel: smooth velvety mouthfeel. 

Overall this a good beer. Very easy to drink but also flavorful. Very refreshing on an hot day. Apparently it’s brewed in Saint Louis and not in Belgium now which is sort of disappointing. I would recommend this beer to anyone who’s looking for a flavorful lager without any frills. This beer is easily better than other European import beers, and it’s readily available at most stores."

Smelled that slightly skunky smell that I get on pretty much all lagers. Smell got worse with every sip as it warmed, eventually getting urine-y. : (

Tastes better than it smells. Smooth and bready, no real top-end crispness but very little bitterness. Full in the middle range. 

Feels smooth too. Not overly carbonated. 

Waaaay better than standard American lagers. I’d happily drink it if it were offered. Don’t need to go out of my way for it, though."
1910,Stella Artois,3.48,"Pours a very pretty crystal clear brass color, nice very white cohesive head that settles into some clumpy white islands, some of which try to cling to the glass in a show of minor lacing. Swirling the glass around gives a nice visual as the carb is visible and replenishes the head.

Nose is a mix of white bread, cracker, wafer like, light macro lager skunkiness, and very light floral leaning hops, I would stop short of saying floral though.

The taste is surprisingly refreshing, while cold especially, has a generic very light maltiness that carries a very minor touch of sweet; reminds me of wonder bread but less doughy; some definite hop presence, lightly peppery but they are definitely outshined by the malt. The malty sweet slowly becomes more powerful as this beer warms.

Light body, slightly effervescent, some light sweetness coats the tongue but it finishes surprisingly dry with a low-moderate bitterness; has a nice snappy finish to me. As this beer warms it becomes sweeter and has more of a macro lager taste/feel to it.

I'm enjoying this beer a lot more than I thought I would have, compared to other mass produced euro lager it actually isn't half bad. Worth giving a shot, in my opinion."

Poured cloudy brownish color with a tan head. The smell is sweet and almost of a maple syrup. The flavor is sweet and has a warmth boozie feel. A decent beer, if you like sweetness in your beers. Not my kind of beer but hey, it was a one off shot."

1943,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.06,"(BBD 28 Dec 22) - Nitro version. Poured a velvety black color from a 14.9 oz. can into a standard pint glass with a creamy finger high head that receded slowly and left curtain lacing that clung to the glass as it dissipated. Aroma is earthy and grainy which is fairly standard for the style. Taste is chocolate forward but is not overly chocolaty and has hints of chicory, roasted malts & grain. Mouth is smooth, medium bodied with a clean finish and is very drinkable. Picked up for under $10 for a 4 pack and was quite pleased wit the purchase."

1947,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.58,"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle dated 28 JUL 22 to a diagonally cut tumbler at fridge temp but was slowly sipped and allowed to warm.
The body is opaque black with a short, deep tan head on top that fades but provides some quickly disappearing lacing. 
Chocolate is dominant in the smell as is the alcohol. Some dried fruit can be sensed also.
The taste brings the dried fruit out more prominently; cherrys, raisins, all “chocolate covered”. This beer bridges between the sweet and the bitter. Overall the taste is reminiscent of a box full of a fruity alcohol chocolate sampler.
Mouthfeel seems rather thin frankly, but it does leave your lips sticky.
I am not quite sure about how I feel about this beer. It was worth the experience, but will not be a repeat purchase."

Looks superb in the glass. Jet black body, cream colored creamy head which persists throughout leaving a layer of lacing.

Creamy aroma, but smells a little off.

On tasting, not getting as much chocolate as I hoped, but a sweet creamy stout with a light roast at the end for balance.

Mouth just about reaches medium, finish roasty.

Overall, some flaws in all categories except the look."
1951,Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.19,"A bit surprised I had never reviewed this beer before.

1961,Furious,4.46,"Happy to see this arrive in Alberta!
Pours a crystal clear dark copper/amber with two fingers of creamy off white/tawny head.
Aroma is a wonderful mix of citrus peel, grapefruit, piney resin and a bit of caramel malt with a floral note. As warmed there is just a hint of weedy dankness.
Taste follows with sweet caramel malt - a burst of hop flavours - grapefruit peel, pine resin, some floral flavours and a robust bitterness.
Medium full mouthfeel, bright carbonation and a lingering bright bitterness.
Just a treat."
1962,Furious,4.15,
1963,Furious,4.1,"Clear copper with a foamy head that falls into craters. Nose and taste generically remind me of a hoppy amber ale, with a bit of melanoidin and some metal. That metallic not is something I often get in amber ales, especially with a dose of piney hops, which Furious has a bunch of. It’s evident in the first sip late, and moves forward with each sip. The beer overall is a fairly straightforward American bitter beer with a bit of a malt backbone."
1964,Furious,3.97,"On tap at Whistle Binkies in Rochester. Pours a nice amber/copper colour with a thin ring around the edges.

1974,Furious,4.12,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single from a local bar/bottle shop for $3.50. Canned on 11/29/22, so this is just under three months old.

Look: Dark ruby amber color, clear. Crumbly, rocky, sticky off-white head.

Smell: Grapefruit and very earthy, woody pine resin. Caramel malt backbone. Overall, the aromas seem to be a bit restrained.

Taste: This is a solid beer. Up front, it's pretty tame with a pleasant caramel malt backbone and some grapefruit flavor. Then the profile quickly gets aggressively bitter and the finish is full-on grapefruit pith, zest, and pine resin. The finish is very bitter and very enjoyable. There's just something about the combination and contrast of flavors between grapefruit and darker malts that is so tasty and interesting. This beer takes that flavor profile to the extreme, and it's pretty cool. Over time, I get bitterness from roasted malts coming through on the finish also. Those roasted malt flavors mimic a coffee bitterness, which is pretty cool, and this beer also reminds me of like a grapefruit/coffee drink (LaColombe used to make coffee shandies with Lemon, Grapefruit, or Cherry).

Feel: It has a medium plus body, chewy mouthfeel. it's pretty slick and oily yet it also has a degree of crispness. Nicely carbonated.

Overall: My second Surly Brewing Company beer (Controlled Chaos was the first). This beer reminds me a lot of Imperial Red Ales like Terrapin Big Hoppy Monster and Troegs Nugget Nectar. I think that if this beer was a bit higher in alcohol, then it would fall into that category. And this beer also reminds me a bit of Maine Beer Company Zoe, which is an American Amber / Red Ale.

I am currently sipping one and I'm 32 years old. I remember seeing the cap with the hypnotizing swirl on it and witty sayings in the cap when I was just a kid. When I got older I started drinking these and understood why my parents loved them. I hope this beer stays around long enough for me to keep enjoying my childhood. As weird as that seems, with this beer and reading the caps it reminds me of the good times I once had when I was little growing up in the 90s. I miss that free spirit attitude everyone had and the beers taste helps me reminisce those awesome years."

2003,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,4.02,
2004,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,1.18,"This was one of the nastiest tastings beers I’ve ever had. It looked good, but tasted like Apple cider vinegar. I guess if you’re used to drinking crappy beer then this is a good one. But, if you’re used to drinking craft beer then this rivals the cigarette ash tasting Miller Lite. Never again!

It has no real smell; perhaps faint lemon peel? The taste is faint lemon and citrus notes with a pinch of wheat. Overall, this one is worth a try when in season, iced cold and if you've at least never tried it before."
2012,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.21,"Pours murky yellow with a white cap that fades rapidly. Minimal lacing. Aroma is faint, lemony and some grain. Flavor is also mild, citrusy and bready.

2014,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,2.22,"Another American-style beer that is overly sweet to my taste, this one resembles a higher-end version of ""Modelo Especial"" or Miller ""High Life."" It does not have strong smells, maybe has a faint hint of citrus, but mostly has a nice easy not too intense taste with a lot of sweetness and a little more alcohol than is normal for this type of beer. I thought it was quite good for what it was, but would prefer less of a confection."
2015,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.57,"A medium light haze in an orange-amber golden body. Nose is citrusy - a little more lemon than orange but a mix of both. Taste and feel seem a little watered down after that impression. It’s a little spritzy in carbonation, but fairly light and refreshing with a medium dry finish. Wheat influence isn’t as strong as I’d hoped for and the citrus is a little weak on the palate, with a mix of orange and lemon peel coming out as it warms."

2021,White,4.26,"Pours hazy white with light head.
Aromas of spice and fruit.
Getting grapefruit or grapefruit peel like tastes, but very nice overall. Also notice that there are sour notes, which is somewhat unpleasant, but because of the other tastes, it's overall very nice.
Has a medium feel in the mouth.

Light carbonation, easy drinking, highest recommendation. Easily one of my favorite beers, and a founding father of craft beer!"

Smells of light citrus, pine and malt sweetness. Some kind of candy flavor that I can't pinpoint.

Tastes like an old school IPA with classic C hops. Pine and grapefruit. Just enough malt backbone to balance it out. A little grassiness in the finish that follows with a really nice crisp bitterness to finish it off. A little bit of 'chrw' to the beer as it finishes.

Mouthfeel is a little chewy, strong carbonation and a little slick.

2064,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.3,"Poured into a goblet: color is amber, transparent, head is off white and presents 1 finger thick, dissipates to a solid top, some lacing and streaking on the glass sides. 

Smell is big, bitter, slightly biting - notes of pine, earth, citrus, juniper, some honey and syrupy notes, light caramel. 

Taste is similar with big, bitter notes of hops and alcohol - pine, earth, citrus, honey, syrup, light toast and caramel, some tonicy/herbaly/juniper notes. 

Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation, moderate sweetness, strong bitterness and slight boozy burn. 

Overall - amazed that big, big non-hazy IPAs are this hard to find - so much more nuance, flavor, and drinkability."

2067,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.06,
2068,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.05,"6 oz pour on tap at Lures Bar & Grille. Pours a clear caramel color (lighter than a brown ale) with a small head. Aroma and flavor feature dank pine, grapefruit rind, caramel malt, sticky resin, and moderate booziness. Bitterness is offset by malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is full and moderately carbonated. Overall it's a nice throwback DIPA but doesn't blow me away."
2069,RuinTen Triple IPA,4.33,"(12 oz can, EJBY 08/13/22; purchased cold single at Shangy's last week... poured into a fat tulip)

L: clear, tawny-colored liquid with perhaps a faint hop haze; cratery, exploded foam sponge upon pour, collapsing quick into a thick, gummy collar... two droopy eyebrows of lace

S: semi-characteristically Stone melange of piney, outdoorsy, juice nectary hops along with a cane-sugar syrupy malty underbelly and moderately strident, tonic ethanol kick... upon further sniffage, an herbal cannabis overtone all day... supreme vibrancy if a bit indistinct in its aroma indentifiers

T: bitter-herbal, pungent hops blasting the palate roof while a jammy, citrusy hop and malt nectar permeates the palate floor with its airy, booze-shocked essences... the aftertaste is leavings of fruit and sugar sweetness with the peppery charge of biting bitterness still attacking the top, even cutting through to the sinuses... it's almost like a Malort and Cointreau-infused strong amber ale

F: resinous, silken, near cordial glory, lithe and luxurious yet punishingly pungent... its glassy, ghostly undercurrent is perhaps (along with its hot sauce fire) its most striking characteristic, as it seems to just float in the ether 

O: for all it's brashness, quintessentially Stone in its relentless (to me, fantastic) bitterness, it sports jagged facets of two-dimensional, static, obscure, muddy expressions... I'm somewhat enjoying this, but craving something more characterful, though its tactile sensations are leaving me perplexed and intrigued (1970)"
2070,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.85,"Deep gold with decent head. It smells like alcohol and piney hops. Taste is bitter, a little hot, some malt , herbal, piney, with some fruit flavor poking through. Pretty strong and a little rough around the edges but not unbalanced and fairly easy to drink despite its profile. It reminds me of the original Hoptimum a little. Not a bad strong ale but I’ll file this in the been there done that and move on to other things, cheers!"
2071,RuinTen Triple IPA,2.89,"Disappointingly long lasting bitter after taste with no sweetness at all - unusual for double digit ABV. Reminds me a little of scotch ales with a strong, dark, almost metallic mouth feel followed by the bitterness. A strong beer that unfortunately did not get better with a second can.
I like Stone beers, but this I won't buy again"
2072,RuinTen Triple IPA,3.76,"Canned April 15th enjoy by August 13th 2022.

Pours a clear gold, not much to talk aboot in the foam department. 

Smells extremely hoppy but with a big malty bite. Citrus, some pine, leans into some tropical fruit but not hugely. 

Huge Citrus bitterness and the malty sweetness is almost as huge, call it in balance, I reckon. Alcohol is there in spades but it is not hard to deal with. 
A little bit spicy, earthy, vegetal, short sips are best for me. 

Sticky, somewhat juicy mouthfeel. 

Kind of wearing on the palate but I enjoy it."

Look: Old gold body, nice off-white head. 

Smell: Pine, floral notes, orange peel, 

Taste: Intense grapefruit hops--almost abrasive (in a good way!). Some sweet toffee malts mid-palate, fresh squeezed orange juice too. Clean, citrus-lemon finish with slightest white pepper alcohol note/burn. Wow.

Feel: Very big beer fuller medium to full bodied IPA.

Overall: This beer would be awesome to pair with food. Doesn't make sense to have more than one of these IMO, but this is an awesome West Coast IPA. The kind of IPA that got me into craft beer in the first place--very nostalgic and fun to try. And a pretty reasonable price point to boot. If I can find another fresh batch I'm definitely trying this again."

2083,Maximus,4.25,
2084,Maximus,4.03,"Delicious and noteworthy for how well balanced is, as the brewery notes. Lovely deep golden color with a healthy, itinerant head. Pretty straightforward nose here dominated by hops. This also has powerful hop flavors that are craftily balanced with sweet bready malts. A little thin on the mouthfeel maybe. Really really tasty and gets right on top of you thanks to the well masked alcohol notes in the 9-percenter."

Today I decided to give Lagunitas Maximus a try and I glad I did. I tried a few of their beers an I like this one the best. It packs a wallop at 9.00 APV and consider it coats only 2 for $5.49 it's a good value. This IPA has a strong taste an is worthy to being called an IPA, with its pungent hops and bite. This beer type is not for everyone so if you like Coors or Miller please stay away because it's got too much taste for you. For what you get it's amazing."

2097,Maximus,3.91,"Picked up a tallboy can with a date of 03/07/23.

Pours an amber, copper in color with a finger thick head of frothy foam that leaves lacing on the glass as you drink. Carbonation looks average with small bubbles rising from the bottom. There's plenty of hop residue left in the beer from the dry hopping process. Looks to be pretty balanced.

Balanced on the nose as well with rich, roasted malts and lemon candy hops. Lots of fruitiness in there, though a bit hard to distinguish notes. Maybe some blood orange and mango as it warms. There's a bit of a sweet/sour thing going on as well. It's not overly aromatic, surprisingly.

Definitely hop forward, but remains pretty balanced on the tongue. Roasted malts dominate up front, giving way to the fruity, citrusy, spicy hops towards the swallow but remaining throughout. Picking up notes of apple, pineapple and cherry. The finish is surprisingly mild with some roasted malts and pine on the tongue. Not picking up any alcohol until perhaps the final swallow.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a solid amount of chewiness and subdued carbonation which works quite well. The finish is pretty dry. It does coat the tongue a bit over time but is surprisingly not much of a palate wrecker. Dangerously drinkable at 9% ABV.

Haven't picked up anything from Lagunitas in awhile, thought I would give this one a shot. It definitely has the profile of a classic double IPA, well balanced but also pungently hopped. There's a lot of complexity to savor here as well, especially as the beer warms, but it's also quite drinkable. I'm not a huge double IPA fan, I have them only occasionally, but if the style is part of your rotation this one is sure to please. A very solid offering. Cheers!"
2098,Maximus,3.85,
2099,Maximus,3.65,"Look: Pours a slightly orange shade of yellow with a one finger, rocky head of off white foam. Below average lacing. Moderate head retention.

Aroma: The nose is fruit punch like - with notes of sugary orange, pineapple juice and sweet cherry. Sort of anemic and weak, I really have to stick my nose deep down in the glass to get much of anything.

Taste: Surprisingly not as sweet as the nose would let on, and strangely well balanced for such a strong imperial IPA. Reminds me of a dole fruit cup. Upfront I'm tasting some nice notes of bittersweet toffee and dry caramel. Midpalate is rounded out by some nice tropical flavors of pineapple juice and tangy/sweet orange juice. There's a brief flash of shredded coconut and sour cherry. The finish is bitter and resinous, but not overpowering, ending with restrained notes of pine sap and a slight spicy garlic note.

Feel: Alcohol profile is slightly noticeable. Mouthfeel is slightly oily and sticky, but not sugary. Dry/fruity. A touch on the heavy side but not decisively so. Carbonation level is moderate.

Overall: This is very ""fruit cocktail"" like (probably the mosaic hops), it's not exactly my style but I enjoyed it. The first time I tried this beer a year or two ago I didn't like it at all and thought it wasn't even worth rating or reviewing. After having decided to try it again I was pleasantly surprised how my taste has changed. This isn't anything life changing or mind blowing but I'd recommend it if you've never tried it and are looking for a strong Imperial IPA that isn't to that ""slap you in the face"" level of hop intensity and bitterness."

2101,Orval Trappist Ale,4.6,"Bottled 07/09/2022, best by 07/09/2027.
It poured a snifter full of cloud-white foam, but gave off a spice aroma as I practiced that virtue called patience. As the foam went down and I could finally pour at least to the second pour line, the scent was tart sour.
The taste was subtle with finessed flavors: a sweetness, back notes of pepper. And hops! All in a light mouthfeel. The aftertaste was of ground cinnamon."
2102,Orval Trappist Ale,4.3,
2103,Orval Trappist Ale,4.43,"It appears that this may be the highest rated brew of its style on beer advocate ... The rating is well deserved as this is quite delicious .... I'll have to look back at other beers I've reviewed of the style to compare ... I'm admittedly not blown away, but darn it is good"
2104,Orval Trappist Ale,4.08,
2105,Orval Trappist Ale,4.03,"Smell is frankly almost nonexistent -- not very aromatic. Some malt, honey, florals. The body, however, is extremely tangy, almost like drinking a sparkling water, with a closely following body of heavy spice, florals, and honey. It's lightning in a bottle, followed by ambrosia. Very unique, very delicious."
2106,Orval Trappist Ale,4.23,"11.2 oz bottle poured into an appropriate glass. Bottled on 7/7/2022 and consumed on 7/16/2023, so this has a year on it. Unknown aging conditions (it was a recent find at a store). Started fridge temperature and slowly warmed to room temperature while drinking.

Look: Incredible head! The beer is a hazy golden color, with one of the thickest off-white heads I’ve ever seen. Pouring this thing is a risky adventure, with overflow a real possibility! The head sticks around for a long time, with tiny bubbles rising through the beer to keep it going long after you’d expect it to fade. Minor-to-moderate lacing.

Smell: Exceptionally unique, so much so that it’s hard to find appropriate words. There is a definite medicinal aroma, but oddly it’s not off-putting. A dry fruity character is present, somewhat (but not exactly) reminiscent of cider. A bit of lemon zest. There’s more, but appropriate words are not coming to me. Many reviews mention band-aids in the aroma, and while I understand where they are coming from I don’t think this is quite an accurate description of the Brett funk in this beer.

Taste: So very dry! As this first hits my mouth the dry, medicinal quality is very up-front. Peppery spice (without heat) is also noticeable. The cider-like aroma shows up in the taste as well, although there’s none of the fruity sweetness you find in a cider. There’s a bitterness that reminds me of citrus fruit rinds. The Brett funk is present in a way that may or may not be enjoyable (I change my mind on every sip!), but is hard to otherwise describe with mere words.

Feel: Exceptionally well-carbonated. I don’t always like high amounts of carbonation, but it works extremely well in this instance.

Overall: As of my writing of this review, this is the #1 ranked Belgian Pale Ale. It’s an exceptionally unique ale, with one of the most interesting and complex flavor and aroma profiles I’ve ever encountered outside of barrel-aged adjunct stouts. The taste is so exceptionally dry I’m honestly not sure if I love or hate this. I do know I’m going to pick up a few more bottles while they are still available in my area, and probably run an aging experiment."

2110,Orval Trappist Ale,4.23,"7/2/23, enjoying at home, single bottle purchased at Pig and Fire.

Highly carbonated, so poured a very airy, foamy light head which dissipated rather quickly. Only slightly hazy, golden in color.

Aromas of bubble gum, mead, floral, and a slight root beer aroma that's coming through.

Very effervescent in the mouth. Ends with a slight bitterness. Flavors of banana, bubble gum, banana bread, and vanilla. Ends with a lemony bitter finish. And low and behold, the taste of a fresh Band-Aid, as noted by @tsar_riga! Weird, but it's good! Not a super fan of the finish, but really good overall."

The look of this is a very red tinted brown , medium carbonation bubbles on the glass and a short lived, large bubbled head that reduces to a tiny ring , almost no lacing . The smell is of yeast and apple , almost cider like . The taste follows on from the smell with highly prolific yeast that gets heavier as you drink , light apple, malt and a pleasant bitterness , a slight hint of banana lingers.

Taste is subtle, with a bit of malt, spice, pepper, Brett funk, almost stale hop quality. Feel is light bodied, well carbonated, finish is dry. Overall, this is excellent beer, of course. Lots of complex flavor, well constructed, and very approachable."
2120,Maharaja,4.27,
2121,Maharaja,4.51,"Purchased as single at Pilgrim's Market in CdA, ID - canned May 10/23. 10.0% ABV.
Pours a chill hazed golden apricot bronze with two fingers of creamy off white/tawny tinged head.
Nose is a burst of hops - citrus/orange, piney resin, some tropical fruit, and even a bit of peach. There is a tiny bit of a soapy floral aroma and notes of caramel malt.
Taste is initially sweet citrus, mango, again some peach, with caramel malt. Resinous pine, a herbal dank and sticky bitterness slowly builds. There is almost a touch of vanilla orange creamsicle sweetness.
Full and sticky bittersweet mouthfeel with a pleasant alcoholic warmth."
2122,Maharaja,4.5,
2123,Maharaja,4.09,"Excellent imperial. Very heavily hopped. Crisp and drinkable despite the higher ABV. The hops bites like a snake as you sip it, but it quickly fades away and is replaced by a mild sweetness. There's nothing overly complex going on here. No exotic notes to speak of. It's a fairly basic imperial IPA in composition, but man is it done well. Will be buying this again, and would probably put it in my top 5 list for imperials.

A borderline world-class imperial IPA in my opinion. It's good. Give it a try. I'm always impressed with Avery beers, whether it be an IPA, a stout, or whatever else."
2124,Maharaja,4.27,"L- Beautiful golden orange that you can barely see through. Billowy white head that is slowly dissipating. I wouldn't say turbid, but lots of small floaties 

S- piney and rosin. With some Citrus zest

T- sweet with a boozy bite. Slight bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Orange Citrus notes.

F- slick with a little chewiness. Lightly carbonated but still bright.

O- Very enjoyable for a 10% IPA. I wasn't expecting it drinking this clean."
2125,Maharaja,4.36,"1/27/2023 brew date. Very drinkable double IPA. Many DIPAs at 9% or above start to taste funny, like too much sugar residue, or just bland or unbalanced in some way. This one tastes very solid. A bit piney, hoppy, bitter, like an IPA should taste. I say this is well done, and I've had most DIPAs out there. Worth the $3 a can at 10% ABV."
2126,Maharaja,4.39,From a can produced 1/27/23. Amber color with an inch of foamy tan colored head. Piney hop smell. Full bodied. Big caramel malt flavor followed by dank piney hops. This thing packs a punch!
2127,Maharaja,4.25,
2128,Maharaja,3.71,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $3.50. Canned on 10/4/2022, which makes this one day shy of three months old.

Look: Pours a very nice copper color with a slight haze and a fluffy/rocky beige-colored head.

Smell: Strong, hoppy aromas of citrus (grapefruit), pine, and dank notes. Not much else to say. It smells like it will be a bit boozy and there are a lot of spicy hop characteristics coming through. Overall, the aromas are a bit muted.

Taste: My first impression is that this beer does taste very boozy. Up front there is a nice caramel malt backbone, which pretty quickly is overtaken by a plethora of spicy and dank hops. The finish is very bitter with tons of pine resin and some grapefruit rind and pith. It finishes on the dry side and it leaves a warming sensation in the chest.

Feel: It has a slick, oily kind of mouthfeel that is also a bit chewy. Carbonated appropriately. It's also boozy.

Overall: This is very much a West Coast style Imperial IPA. It uses predominantly old school hop varieties and its expression is very much old school. I probably had this beer many years ago and I doubt that I was able to appreciate it then. Honestly, for me it's enjoyable yet I find it to be a bit boring. It's not my favorite style of beer, but I can definitely appreciate it for what it is. It's well-made and given that it is three months old, it doesn't seem like it has suffered much due to age.

From the can/website:
The Maharaja flaunts his authority over a deranged amount of hops: tangy, vibrant, and intense along with an insane amount of malted barley – fashioning a dark amber hue and exquisite malt essence. Maharaja is derived from the sanskrit words mahat, meaning “great”, and rajan, meaning “king”. Much like its namesake, this Imperial IPA is regal, mighty, and dank. With citrusy hops and caramel toffee malts as his servants, he rules both with a heavy hand. Don't be fooled by unassuming drinkability, this beer is potent. Welcome to his kingdom!

REGAL | MIGHTY | DANK

Brewed with Rocky Mountain water, malted barley (C-120, Aromatic, 2-Row), hop varieties (Columbus, Chinook, Centennial, Simcoe), dry-hop varieties (Idaho 7, Vic Secret, Simcoe) & yeast (House Ale Strain)"
2129,Maharaja,4.22,"I used to drink this one back in 2014/15 in bombers when I could get it. I recently picked up some cans and although I enjoyed it, did not have the same reaction to what I remembered in the past. The nose on it is what really convinced me something was different. I used to be blown away by just how big and fruity the smell on it was, but the cans were muted in comparison. Still a great beer."

2138,Maharaja,8.309999999999999,
2139,Maharaja,3.66,"Ok this one is pretty. It's a orangeish copper barely translucent with a white head that settles into a nice cap and leaves lacing all over the walls of the glass. It smells very sweet with caramel bites and a touch of piney mangoes, but it's not as fragrant as expected. The alcohol is present on this one. The gates is sweet and warming up front followed by a nice tropical fruit flavor that compliments the alcoholic sweetness nicely. This one goes down too smoothly for a double digit abv beer. I could drink 2 of these in a row without feeling like I've over done it, which is rare with me and DIPAs. If you see it on draft get yourself a pull but I don't see myself buying a four pack of this."

Smell and taste of dark chocolate, sweet plums, and cinnamon. Some smokey malt and vanilla. Silky smooth feel. I understand why this beer is a craft classic!"
2145,Yeti,4.29,"Black and impenetrable to light. There’s a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering three quarters of the top. Heavy, soapy lacing.

2146,Yeti,4.27,"Opaque black color with some ruby highlights and a massive milk chocolate colored head with some nice lacing. 
The aroma is dark roast malt, caramel, toffee, espresso and hints of dark chocolate. 
The taste is dark sweet malt up front followed quickly by the bite of dark coffee, dark chocolate and a blast of herbal hops. This is almost taste overload, massive malt sweetness backed up with serious bitterness from both the roasted malt and major hops. 
The body is full, good level of carbonation, still smooth and drinkable but best for sipping after dinner or anytime you can just relax and enjoy something really appropriate to the name."
2147,Yeti,4.51,The roastiest (?) stout I’ve ever tried. Sweetness up front gives way to awesome bitterness! Smells of nice bitter chocolate that definitely Carrie’s over to the taste. I will definitely be searching this out again!
2148,Yeti,4.4,Poured from a 12oz can. The color is pitch black. Moderate foamy tan head. Mild hop aroma with coffee hints. Flavor is quite hoppy. Reminds me of Victory’s “Storm King “. Nice dark chocolate flavor. Dry finish and thick mouthfeel. I’m glad I finally got around to trying this!
2149,Yeti,4.37,"Pint can poured into an Avery snifter. Pours a deep brown with a fine tan head that lingers.

Full bodied, low to medium carbonation.
Overall, one of my personal favorite American Stouts. Well crafted, travels well."

2151,Yeti,4.39,"Strong almost expresso bean flavor, followed by dark / slightly bitter (bakers) chocolate. Mouth feel is pretty good, a little syrupy compared to North Coast Old Rasputin - but the flavor is very similar.

2166,Pseudo Sue,4.47,"Poured from the 16oz can into a pint glass. The beer is a bright hazy orange color, murky and opaque, topped with a 2 finger fizzy off-white head. I am thinking I will need to fight comparisons to King Sue, but for the appearance, it isn't as ""milky"" as I would have described the other beer. It is a little duller. It looks like a very hazy IPA.

Smell is very strong and refreshing and apparent from some distance away, even when just opening the can. Quite tropical. Orange and citrus rind. Grapefruit juice. Pineapple, mango. Balance upon further inspection in some bready malt within. Some piney hop in the mix, but not as much as advertised or described by other reviewers, in my opinion.

Taste has a bit more of the pine notes, but it also more balanced with a more malty character than anticipated. Biscuit. Honey. It is lacking some of the heat I perceived in King Sue, but that is a good thing. Smooth. Fruit again is tropical with a lot more orange and mango. Tropical notes throughout, but balanced with a dryness. Finishes with a touch of pine.

Drinkable. Accessible. This is possibly a gateway beer that I would introduce others to craft with. But that being said, it is far from bland. In many ways, this is what I want most hazy IPAs to be. Balanced, refreshing, tropical, flavorful. Even (almost) sessionable. I wouldn't call it ""exciting"" (some of the best beers are not) but I would call it world-class for the style. Does exactly what you want."

Nice tart citrus aroma; lemon, grapefruit, not overly sweet or sour or candied or perfume-like--quite restrained. Very wheat-y, some green banana, hay, and a touch of spices.

Nice pop of lemon and orange upfront, green banana, coriander, doughy malt, hay. Vanilla on the finish. Clean and crisp.

You will thank me in the morning. It makes for great conversation. The monks don't fonk around . You need not be a beer snob. But there is no reason to drink bud, Coors, miller.

Aroma: Corn, straw, cereal grains, and muted but slightly detectable floral hop notes. Honestly, there isn’t much going on here
Taste: Starts out with cereal grains and straw but with a watered down taste to it before wafts of spotty floral hop notes peek in occasionally. Corn comes on in the second act and lingers before grains and water close it out
Mouthfeel: Light and watery, clean, medium-high carbonation, and a clean and crisp finish
Overall: What can I say – it’s Coors Light. The watered down sibling of the Banquet beer is exactly that and doesn’t bring much to the table aroma nor taste-wise, although refreshing on a hot day when your thirsty. I would and do pick a ton of non-light AAL’s over this when the occasion calls"

Overall: I remember drinking this beer decades ago when I first turned 21, and I recall and distinct skunky odor and taste (which I attributed to the green bottle letting in too much light): I am very happy that skunky flavor and aroma is now gone (I'm not sure what the Heineken Corporation did, since they still use the same green bottles), and the result is a clean and refreshing lager."

2238,Heineken Lager Beer,2.64,"I like drinking matching beers to occasions that make sense to me. This was my grandfather's favorite beer, I'm drinking it late night on what would have been his one hundredth birthday.

22 oz bottle acclimated to 48°F and poured into a pilsner glass.

Pours a clear, very slightly pale (pale in saturation not in pitch) yellow gold with a 1 finger foamy white head.

Initial aroma is that quintessential lager smell, crisp with slight hops. Somewhat skunky and diluted to my nose. After agitating it smells a little cleaner overall. A deal has been struck to quench thirst and fulfill expectation, not to excel in any field.

Initial taste before swallowing is a little skunky and hoppy. After swallowing I get a minor amount of hops and bitterness. Sweetness like that in cheap white bread, and maltiness akin to malt vinegar. It's a little dry. Overall, this is a lager that exists.

Mouthfeel is fine, smoother than some I've had but it honestly doesn't do anything special.

I may buy Heineken again, likely not. As stated in the beginning, I purchased it because it was my grandfather's favorite and I'm drinking it to honor his 100th birthday. Maybe as a once a year occasion for his birthday. It's one of those that you need to be in the right headspace for. I met it head on knowing full well it would not exceed expectations, but that does not excuse it's lackluster performance as far as raw numbers go. Sorry Grampy, I know you loved it."

2245,Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.17,"11.2 oz acclimated to 58°F and poured into a goblet.

Pours a murky cedar brown with lighter flecks of sediment drifing around. Has a 1 finger foamy white head, dissipating quickly and leaving a nice film of lacing.

Initial aroma is rum extract and general dried fruit (primarily prune). Maybe chestnut or something else that's nutty? Also present is a sweet dairy smell, combining with the rum extract smell I can't help but think it eggnog or custard. A general Christmas spice can be found, as well as a hint of vanilla. This is a lovely and inviting smell that immediately brings to British/Christmas desserts, wonderful. Agitating conjures a creamy dairy aroma, followed by that rum smell.

Initial taste before swallowing is peppery, vaguely fruity, and slightly sweet, building into some alcohol burn. After swallowing a mellow maltiness comes forward, accompanied by a rum extract note and nutmeg notes, quickly a sweetness builds, joined afterwards by a moderate alcohol burn. I pick up a note of bourbon vanilla further in in the exhale and aftertaste, as well as brandy or whiskey or similar later. The aftertaste remains mostly sweet and dried fruit flavored. Throughout the whole experience I couldn't shake the feeling I was drinking eggnog, which personally I am largely in favor of.

Feel is creamy, almost like drinking thin milk. I find that it flows effortlessly. The carbonation doesn't last, unfortunately, but otherwise the mouthfeel is very nice.

Overall, superb. The only gripe I have is that I found it a tiny bit lacking in flavor. Odd, considering the alcohol content, and I think the flavors present are magnificent, but I yearn for just a smidge more. Otherwise there's nothing negative to say. The whole experience was very enjoyable and I look forward to trying it again.

Will certainly buy again for special occasions, just need to determine which of the 4 by the brewery is my favorite. Will absolutely recommend the 4 as well."

S - Inviting aromas are mostly malt-based, giving dried fruits and a light nuttiness. Over that is a gentle herbal hops note and light yeast phenolics, which give it a classic Belgian flair.

T - The flavors are gentle, but keep going into great depths. Plums, prunes, raisins; graham crackers and toast; light cloves, dill and a hint of black pepper.

F - Medium body. Gentle, smooth carbonation. Medium hops bitterness that perfectly balances the malt sweetness. Alcohol is evident, but is surprisingly light for the ABV.

O - This is a deep, nuanced beer. It is never in-your-face, but leaves a beautiful impression of craftsmanship and complexity. Only the slightly murky appearance hurts its score for me."

Aroma of toasted caramel malts, orange, pineapple, and pine resin.
Taste is kind of sweet and proclaims loudly the citrus and pine. Bitterness is noticeable, but not extreme. All fade slowly in the aftertaste.

Taste is fine, but the hops have diminished greatly. Much malt on the palette... too much malt for the style (likely because of how old the beer is; even though 4 months is not very long...)

Normally, the citrusy or fruity flavors in a Saison come from the yeast, but here the hops shine brighter than the yeast. Also, the taste and finish are sweeter than I like, despite the generous amounts of hops. It's a great beer, but a little too sweet and with a weird choice of hops for my personal taste.

The brew is a deep brown-amber, almost mahogany, bright and surprisingly clear for all the color. The only aroma is that almost woody sourness common to good barrel aged ales. The barrel tannins dominate even the Brettanomyces and currants to taste. no minor feat. Yet, the taste is complex enough that they can be specifically detected. There are too many sours that are really some degree of tart. This is also a little tart, but it's unmistakably sour. The woody tannins linger a little too long in the aftertaste.

It's more balanced than I would have given it credit for based on the aroma and the first sip. But it's fizzy and tart without much flavor, to my palate. I don't get fruit, I don't get wine barrel. I don't get chocolate or tobacco or any of the other flavors printed on the label. But I also don't get ethanol, and at 10% ABV, that's really saying something.

Rereviewing after just drinking a Corona Premier, to compare. That is probably the worst beer I have ever had. I do like the bottle design and the Stegosauruses, however I am reviewing the beer, not the artwork.

Rather a pale colour, similar to most beers from Mexico. Aroma is almost nothing, with a little lime. And there is no lime or lemon added ; ) The aroma is a little better than the Premier version.

Taste is so light, I'm completely confused as to why there is also a light version and a Premier version that are even lighter. Hops are mega subtle. But they work well with the lightness. This is much better than the ""Premier"" version. In hot weather I guess this is kind of good and refreshing.

Mouth feel is ok. The hops kind of hit you after the initial wateryness. The mouth feel is the best thing about this. And it was the worst thing about the Premier version.

Overall this isn't as bad (without lime) as I was expecting. It's much much better than the Premier. Beer Advocate reviewing seriously need to wake up as this actually has a much lower score.

As a light beer, this is actually ok. I'm just confused why they decided to create even lighter beers! I feel like if they created another one, I would hover. Maybe if I go to Mexico and live in temperatures each day of 40 centigrade and sweat about mafia murdering me because of giving bad reviews to Corona Premier, I would also like Corona Premier?

It seemed like whenever I’d go over to a buddy’s house, this was the beer in their Dad’s fridge, so I think of that more than I do the cheesy beach commercials. I believe I had a Corona Extra at a bar over fifteen years ago, so this was pretty much like a first impression today. Corona Extra has the skunkiness of a Heineken, without any of the Heineken goodness. It tastes bitter, and not in a fun “beer” kind of way. I added lime to it, and now I totally understand why that’s a thing, but on its own I give it a very generous 2 out of 5.

When warm that skunky and almost metallic like taste comes through hard. The feel is well.. there is none. You can easily drink these beers down when ice cold.

Body: Full bodied and thick, very satisfying on the mouthfeel.

Taste: Nice malt forward upfront, with delicious dark fruits, plums, raisins. Did I say raisin's? Sure did, and it`s delicious followed by some banana in the background, with coffee notes, with bitter sweet chocolate. Despite the 8% abv, no boozy aftertaste at all.

Overall: This is absolutely delicious!! Nice full bodied Scotch Ale loaded with flavor that the craft beer enthusiast will love!! Not a beer to be swilled down due to the the 8% abv. Savor, and enjoy!
Cheers!!"

Feel - medium body, lightly carbonated, bit of syrup on the finish
Overall - Old Chub has a nice deep dark look with good head retention. I really like the smoky malt scent and flavor mixed in with the sweet chocolate and dark roast coffee notes. Solid 8% Scotch Ale I've had many times and find quite enjoyable to drink. Is it too Wee Heavy? I don't think so but find out for yourself. Pick it up and pair it up with The Pretenders - Middle of the Road. Enjoy!"

Aroma is rich and full bodied, lots of strong roasty character, almost a hint of charcoal, some coffee. Taste has these elements, plus hints of chocolate and maybe licorice, firm sweetness but not overly sweet by any means, with enough bitterness and just enough booziness to support it without also becoming overly bitter or boozy.

Look- Black, opaque, medium brown frothy head, average lacing, above average head retention.

Smell- Coffee, cacao, toasted oats, medium strength of scent.

Taste- Coffee, cacao, toasted oats, high strength of flavor.

Feel- Full body, average carbonation, moderately bitter, mildly creamy, silky, mildly mouth coating.

Overall- Look was deep black and opaque with above average head retention. Bouquet was coffee, cacao and toasted oats with medium strength. Flavors were a great balance of coffee, cacao and toasted oats with high strength. The flavor and nose had similar profiles, but the taste stood head and shoulders above the bouquet. Feel was full body with average carbonation and mildly mouth coating. Overall this was an enjoyable experience, but the bourbon barrel aged version of this beer is superior to this iteration."

Consumed on: 26 Feb, 2023
Glass: Snifter
ABV: 10.2%
Serving Temp: ??


Look: 
Black with a thin light brown head. The head quickly dissolves to a ring and filmy cover.

Smell: 
Dark roasted malts with some char. Notes of bittersweet chocolate. There is an earthy and mildly spicy bitterness as well.

Taste: 
What is in the nose is here. The earthy notes are front and center however along with a more noticeable bitterness. As the beer warms, the dark and dusty malts join earthy notes. As the beer warms further, I can detect some espresso and bittersweet chocolate.
Feel: 
Viscous and mouth-coating. The body is just about full.

Overall: 
A solid Imperial Stout that makes a nice winter warmer."
2394,Narwhal,3.98,"L: Jet black pour into a sniffer from a 12oz bottle about 6 degrees, Lacing left behind as the liquid resolves back into liquid form.
S: Dark malts dominate the smell on this followed by dark fruits, followed by heavy molasses. The malt is so dominant that I didn't really smell the bakers cocoa/ espresso.
T: Same as smell intended. The malts dominate the flavor but in the end you can sense the slight bakers cocoa/chocolate, not really the espresso but chocolate.
F: Very smooth lightly carbonated, not acidic, heavy bodied, thick, easy to drink.
O: This isn't a bad imperial. I'd honestly rate it the same as old Rasputin with a smoother complex to it as the malts worked in hand with the thick ending with the chocolate. For me the malts were a bit to much. Maybe less malts would be good with the substitution of more bakers chocolate/ espresso. Very well done. I'm curious to know how it would turn out if barrel aged or even added more bakers chocolate to the mix. Very well done!!!"
2395,Narwhal,4.18,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Opaque motor oil color and consistency. Minimal tan head faded almost immediately. Smells of molasses, brown sugar, maple syrup, bittersweet chocolate. Taste is much more bitter than nose suggested: charred malt, smoke, bitter dark chocolate. Medium-full bodied."
2396,Narwhal,4.4,"Purchased at Carwyn Cellars in March 2022. Drunk in January 2023.

Drunk in company so notes are perfunctory at best.

L: Jet black with a thick, dirty white head. 

S: Dark, rich molasses with umami/soy undertones. There's a cola syrup sharpness underneath. 

T: Very bitter, burnt, dark chocolate with rich caramel and ripe red berries. Some medicinal astringency follows and complements the bitterness well. The beer leaves some harsh bready tones in the mouth after the swallow but again it complements the bitterness and astringency well. 

M: Mouthfeel is smooth and a nice counterpoint to the heat and bitterness. 

O: excellent beer - an absolute sipper and well worth the time.

Dark brown with deep red highlights. A near 1f cap appears briefly before settling to a thick rim film. A few spots of lacing, surprisingly.

Oak aged bourbon and booze aroma up front. Toasted dark bread malts, chocolate, and caramel.

Flavors of bourbon soaked toast and malt, vanilla, dark chocolate, and a touch of cherry wine.

Big and boozy body, yet quite smooth. There’s a light touch of carbonation and the dark chocolate slips in the finish.

An incredibly well aged Barley Wine Ale. A nice tug of war between strong booze and mellow sips."

Drank January ‘23

Caramel brown with a half inch of short lived tan foam. Some suspended sediment from the second pour. Malty sweet aroma, caramel, bread, dark fruit and some mild alcohol. Tastes much the same, with the addition of toffee/molasses type sweetness and a touch of metallic tang. It is sweet but a clean bitter finish keeps the sweetness well in check. Medium body, low carination, smooth and soft closing with a warm alcohol bite.

This has held up well. But the BA character is gone and I’m guessing some of the hop flavor has disappeared but oxidative flavor, really only a small metallic tang, is low. Drinks easy considering the high ABV."

Raisin, boozy, maple, toffee, oak, fig jam on the nose. Taste follows, but with some coffee bitterness to go with the fig, raisin, clove, toasted sugar, chocolate.

I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, coconut, cherry and oak. Really sweet and malty smelling. For the most part I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some raisin, fig and chocolate flavors. It's sweet tasting but not overpowering at all.

2423,Prima Pils,4.16,"This is generally considered an American classic take on German pilsner, and there's a darn good reason for it.

There's a wonderful hoppy bite, but it carries the almost spicy neutrality of Noble hops, not the over the top citrus or tropical fruit of New World varietals. It's hoppy and bitter, but it's by no means an IPL. Drinks crisp and clean, with a bready, grainy deliver of the malt bill. Fairly dry finish.

It's also less complex than the best pilsners, but at the same time, it's not exactly a low volume boutique offering. Getting this kind of quality from a readily available six pack is, frankly, pretty impressive."

Typical Pilsner hops and malting hit the nose. Like many of its style brewed in Pennsylvania, this is an outstanding one. With a body that's supple, yet both smooth and light, it carries the taste near perfectly. There's just enough bitterness to the hops, as it should be. The finish carries that, as it becomes dry. Not much to witness when looking for glass lacing, but that's not why people drink beer. It may not be the best Pilsner brewed in this Commonwealth, but it's better than most made in America."

Overall: A very nice drinking German Pilsner here. Strong floral and bitter hops also with a strong yeast presence that gives hints of juicyfruit. Dry, bitter, yeasty, and clean.

2481,Péché Mortel,3.49,"11.5oz bottle purchased at Community Pint, in Spokane, WA. According to the stamp on the rear level, this was bottled on February 23, 2022. Different label than what is shown here.

Poured into a snifter, this was the color of darkest night, with a thin tan head that did not stick around for very long.

Nose was initially of coffee and molasses. As it warmed, there was an aroma similar to cinnamon that stepped up to the plate.

Very understated. Vaguely coffeeish and cinnamon flavor, but the coffee was really quite muted. Apart from that, just a vaguely roasty malt flavor was present. Bitter coffee flavor at the swallow.

Fairly light bodied for an imperial stout. Kinda watery, really.

I'm not a fan. Maybe this is too old, maybe it was abused by whatever distributor brought it to Community Pint (I'm familiar enough with them to know they store beer well), but I also recall the two other beers I've had from Dieu du Ciel also turned out similarly when I got a chance to try them. Maybe I'm just not on their wavelength, or they're not on mine. I think I'm done trying their beers, short of actually going to Montreal and trying them at the source. Disappointing."
2482,Péché Mortel,4.21,"Finally got to try this top ranked beer in Canada. Does it live up to it’s rep. Lets find out.the pour is indeed thick and black with a coffee collar that stayed for a bit. Nose is coffee roasted goodness with chocolate underlay. Taste is similar with roasted coffee upfront and boozy finish. Feel is light surprisingly, not as much body as I was expecting. Look, it’s good but do think some brewers in Canada have come up with comparables. Rorshach comes to mind as does flying monkeys attempts and third moon. This one has been around for ages and so its reputation has built, but I do feel Ontario can now match it’s prowess."

S: Coffee, cocoa, dark chocolate and vanilla. Dark and smoky with some sweet hints.

T: Dark and malty with notes of coffee and dark chocolate complemented by some smoky hints. Minimal sweetness. Very bitter.

F: Smooth and creamy on the one side. Rather light bodied and drinkable on the other side. Medium carbonation.

2487,Péché Mortel,3.98,"11.5oz can received as a gift from a friend. Batch number 69. I emailed the brewery to ask when this was bottled. They said approximately 2013-10-17, so this beer is almost 9 1/2 years old! Interesting and surprising fact - this is a screw-off bottle cap!

Look: This beer is quite dark (black with brown highlights) but doesn't appear to be so thick. There is a very thin tan-colored head around the rim of the glass.

Smell: Nice roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate aromas. A bit of fruitiness and lots of booze. Slightly reminiscent of chocolate covered cherry cordials.

Taste: It's tasty. For me, this has the right amount of sweetness and bitterness. Up front, it's very roasty and a bit fruity, somewhat sweet. The finish is initially mildly sweet, and then gradually shifts to a full-on bitter, chocolatey and coffee-laden finish.

Feel: It's on the thin side for an Imperial Stout, I would call this medium bodied or perhaps medium plus. Appropriately carbonated - not too much carbonation and not too little either. As I take my time to sip on this, it's not nearly as enjoyable as it loses its carbonation.

Overall: It's a very solid coffee Imperial Stout. I had this beer once before either at a bottle share or at home over 15 years ago. I remember being extremely impressed with it then. I'm not so taken with this beer now. I'm not sure if it's because this bottle has a lot of age on it, or because the bar has been raised for coffee stouts and craft beer in general over time. I think that this is not getting a fair shake due to age. Either way, this aged bottle is good (not amazing in my opinion). Then again, my review needs to be taken in consideration given that this bottle is old and that a fresh bottle will undoubtedly taste different and probably a lot better."
2488,Péché Mortel,4.44,"11.5oz bottle
Bottled Date: 2021-08-12
Consumed on: 17 Feb, 2023
Glass: Snifter
ABV: 9.5 %
Serving Temp: room temp


Look: 
Thick black with a 1-finger creamy light brown head. The head is slow to dissipate and leaves awesome lacing along the glass.

Smell: 
Lightly sweetened medium to light roast coffee. Bittersweet chocolate. Notes of vanilla and a touch of oak. The vanilla makes the brew smell like it has some cream or more accurately creamer (good creamer) in it. A faint wisp of smoke can be detected if one tries.

Taste: 
Wonderfully balanced sweetened medium-roast coffee with a touch of cream and bittersweet chocolate. A nice earthy bitterness is present but is part of the coffee and does not overwhelm. The sip finishes spicy, a bit bitter, but also a touch sweet. Smokiness shows up in the aftertaste.

Feel: 
Smooth and viscous. Some late warmth from the alcohol. The body is medium with a step to the thin side.

Overall: 
An excellent Imperial Coffee Stout. Nicely complex, very tasty, and surprisingly drinkable. The only knock to the brew is its thinner-than-expected body. But that's my issue, not the beer's.

If you like coffee and/or coffee stouts, pick this up and give it a try."

2490,Péché Mortel,5.0,"To be fair I’ve been drinking Peche Mortel for about 12 years. Over the years I’ve had some great beers but this is the only one I’m willing to buy online to make sure I have it readily in stock. 
It pours nearly black with a half finger of creamy, hazelnut-colored head.
The smell let’s you know what kind of a ride you are about to enjoy. A punch of roasted coffee comes first, followed by dark chocolate, dark fruits, leather and tobacco smoke.
The taste follows the nose with each aspect getting to shine as the beer warms. Coffee roast, dark chocolate are front and center with some subtle dark fruitiness giving way to a leather and ash finish. All are well balanced. 
The mouthfeel is creamy with a moderate carbonation but isn't overly boozy for 9.5% ABV.
To this day the best beer I’ve ever had."
2491,Péché Mortel,4.2,"11.5oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled 3/2015, so 7 years old.

Black body, small tan head doesn't last long but leaves a light spider's web of lacing.

Aroma is nicely of coffee.

On tasting, strong coffee flavor, smooth, lightly sweet, some warmth from the abv.

Mouth above medium, finish coffee with a faint roasted malt.

Overall, impressed that 7 years in the bottle doesn't diminish the coffee. Unless a fresh one is an outright coffee bomb."
2492,Péché Mortel,3.99,"2015 vintage; growler into pint glass. Pours essentially black with no head. Initial impression is roasted malts, dark choclate, and coffee grounds.

Not to my liking."
2497,Péché Mortel,4.44,"A magnificent stout with a bold in-your-face roasted coffee flavor. Poured from a twelve ounce bottle dated 2019.

Body poured bible black with initial head that receded to a thin ring around the edge during the tasting.

The nose is roasted coffee with chocolate flavor expressed from the malts. Very pleasing.

The body follows the nose but adds a significant bitterness. Chocolate malts and char arrive with the bitterness than all fade to a dry finish.

Mouthfeel is good though a bit thin for my expectations of a stout of high ABV. The powerful flavor more than compensates.

Coffee fans must track this beer down. You'll thank me later."
2498,Péché Mortel,4.19,"Pours black. Aroma is best feature of this beer. Incredibly intense coffee aroma with equally intense dark chocolate & roasty, smokey char. Taste doesn't match aroma. Tastes like I'm drinking strong coffee. That's it. Mouthfeel is way too thin for me."
2499,Péché Mortel,4.44,"Drinking this fucker walking through Modern Day McArthur Park..if you know you know . It's like the 90s all over again here

Dieu De Ciel - Peche Mortel
Imperial Stout with Coffee.
No bottle date
Not a fan of their label rework at all but it's what's inside that counts right

Drinking it out the bottle so forgive my notes.
Nose is alll roasted coffee goodness, cacao nibs, semi sweet chocolate and dark malts. A bit on the sweeter side .
As with all well made stouts taste follows nose with that big robust coffee flavor , semivsweet chocolate, cacao, dark fruit and big dark malt flavor that adds some sweetness (coffee balances this well cuz its not overpowering sweetness at all, very mild) .

Look: don't know.

Feel: as expected from non ba coffee stout. Lingers on the palate for a while and gives your teeth that 'drinking coffee' dry feel.

Overall : enjoyable no bullshit Coffee Stout.

Really hits the spot. I guess it could be a dessert beer but when its freezing outside and the snow is blowing it'll do. Looks like motor oil with very little head. Just like an imperial stout should. With my diminished sense of smell I get chocolate (imagine that) and malt. Can't decide if its milk chocolate, bittersweet or what but definitely chocolate. Taste is the star here. Chocolate of course but I don't think its too sweet. Nice clean finish I could drink it for dessert but it's fine in front of the fire in the dead of winter. Mouthfeel is almost perfect. Slightly thick, smooth as silk and just about right. Overall, a really good imperial stout.

Pours a lovely burnished red and sports a manilla colored head for a little while.
The aroma is hoppy and malty and just an ideal combination of these.
The taste is where this really shines. Crisp is the word- such a balanced layering of flavors from spices to caramel to citrus and a refreshing bitterness to finish the sip. 
The feel is ideal for the style, I am not sure it can be improved.
OA, it’s always on draft around W Michigan which is good as they seldom bottle or can it as it looses flavor quickly. Or so they say. I’d rather drink an older container of this than not drink it at all.

Pours a reddish brown from the 22 ounce bottle, excellent clarity. Off white, foamy head that was generous and lasted for a time before reducing to a nice, foamy cap.

The smell is not as aggressive as anticipated. I get a sweet impression - caramel/toffee and sweet dark fruits - raisin/fig maybe date. There's enough resinous pine to give a promise of a hefty bitterness, but there are also softer floral notes, an earthiness, a very slight citrus zest. The malts weigh in with biscuits and toast. Spicy like cloves.

The taste delivers on what's promised by the smell. Caramel and toffee lead followed by sweet dark fruit. This rides on the back of the toast and biscuit flavors. Then other flavors come along - a woodiness from the oak, floral, earthy, definite citrus zest resembling orange, and big but not unpleasant sharp bitterness. No sign of the ABV whatsoever. While it could be jagged, everything comes together for a smooth experience.

Everything lingers into the aftertaste. It's got a nice, sticky feel without being overly cloying. Carbonation seems medium and appropriate for this beer. Smooth and creamy. Oddly the beer ""feels good"".

Overall, this was a smooth-drinking flavor bomb. Layered and integrated very nicely even with the substantial kick of bitterness. Well done."

Taste is a bittersweet blend of cocoa, toffee, brown sugar, a hint of coffee, raisin, and bready malt with an earthy hop bite. The sweetness is accented by the distinct booziness that manages to not be overpowering (but this is a sipper).
Full rich mouthfeel - sweet but never cloying - leaving with that warming boozy after burn."

S: The smell of this beer consists of both bourbon and coffee. The aroma lets you know that the taste will be rich.

T: Very Rich in flavor. You can taste chocolate, coffee, plum and bourbon. The beer is very rich an wonderful with it's taste.

Pours a thick black. Smells like it’s been barreled aged! Tastes like a vintage sherry. Decadently sweet, but not in an off putting way. Drinks like liquid figgy pudding.!"
2631,World Wide Stout,4.5,"I tried a 10oz glass of this beer off the tapper at Dry Ground Brewing as a guest tap in Paducah, Kentucky. It poured an opaque dark with thin tan head that did not leave much lace. The scent had subtle common Russian stout notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip. There was dark chocolate roast malt and subtle bitter hop presence. The mouthfeel was fuller in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer."
2632,World Wide Stout,3.95,"2016 Vintage. From the bottle, it pours a deep dark brown/black color with a tiny head that soon dissipates. The nose gets burnt malts and alcohol. The mouth gets a smooth creamy black malt flavored brew. A real sippin' brew.

2636,World Wide Stout,4.0,"Dark brown with a ruby hue and two fat fingers of airy, mocha-colored head. Rocky dissipation fairly quickly settles into wisp and crown.

Big aroma of chocolate, cherry cordials and finger nail polish. Strong umami and shoe leather behind.

Plenty of umami and leather in the taste. A good kiss of chocolate and plum, too. A bit of root beer. Decent alcohol heat. Relatively dry finish.

Slick, oily feel. Light carbonation.

Tasty and complex. 11/1/16 bottling."

2653,Resin,3.71,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.50. PKG 22333, which means that this was packaged on 11/30/22. That would make this beer 2 1/2 months old.

Look: It's a beautiful copper color with a slight haze/particulate floaties in suspension appearance. Nice beige-colored head that is sticking around.

Smell: Mild citrus notes with tons of spicy hop resin and pine. This is probably a bit too cold straight out of my beer fridge, so the full bouquet is not coming out. Some herbal/oniony notes on the finish. Subtle watermelon and papaya notes and some honey thrown in.

Taste: This is aggressively hopped, but you wouldn't really know it from the nose. Up front, there is some caramel malt sweetness with subtle honey notes. Then the hops take over and this is an intensely bitter ride to the finish line and beyond. The bitter finish lingers long and is full of hop resins and earthy, woody pine along with lots of grapefruit peel and pith. All this being said, this Imperial IPA maintains a semblance of balance because there is a significant malt backbone to support the aggressive hop bill. As the hop bitterness on the finish eventually recedes, some cool, peppery watermelon notes are coming through giving this beer an oddly refreshing feeling.

Feel: The body is medium plus with a slick, oily mouthfeel.

Overall: This is a really solid West-Coast Style Double IPA. Personally, Imperial IPAs are not my favorite of styles but I can dig ones in this vein occasionally. For 9.1% ABV, it's quite drinkable. I would like to try to re-review this beer if I can get my hands on a fresher version."

2658,Resin,4.43,"This is a big beer, obviously. At 9.1% it does come across a little boozy which does effect the texture or feel of the beer a bit. That is to be expected with these bigger IPAs though.. Honestly one of my go-tos for a bit, big, fun, citrusy, juicy, resinous, all of the adjectives."
2659,Resin,3.91,"Pours orange gold with off white persistent head and excellent lacing.

Aromas of resin, floral notes and soapy earth. 

The flavors are mostly resin and earth with only a touch of bready malt and grapefruit. Some booze and diesel on the back-end of the palate.

Extremely lively and drying mouthfeel, which helps make this one pretty drinkable.

Epic levels of hop bitterness. A little simple and rough in that regard, but I get what they were going for here. Solid."

It’s Miller Lite, it tastes better than Coors Light and Bud Light, which I’ve known for years. It tastes like a nerfed version of Miller High Life, which isn’t a bad thing if you’re trying to lose your spare tire. It pretends to identify as a pilsner on the label, while being an American adjunct lager, I guess some guy on the marketing team heard the word pilsner back in 1942 and slapped it on can.

2697,Devil Dancer,3.96,"12oz bottle courtesy of Whyteboar. According to the stamp on the rear label, this was bottled on January 16, 2020. Perhaps not ideal for a normal IPA, but as the same rear label makes clear, this ain't no normal IPA, as it clocks in at a fierce 12% abv!

Poured into a tulip-shaped hybrid glass (don't know what else to call it), this was a dark amber color, taking on a rubyish hue when held up to light. About an inch or so of beige colored foam was present as head, and left a decent amount of lace for such a strong beer.

Nose was of herbal grassy hops, bready malts, plus a little bit of band aid type aroma. As it warms, it gets a bit boozy.

More promising in the flavor department than in the nose. Grapefruity, piney, peppery and bready - this is a big beer that makes a big impact on the taste buds. Quite a bit of alcohol ""heat"" is present. Unsurprisingly, for a triple IPA from the midwest, there's a massive malt backbone, so for the hops to stand out as much as they do, there must have been an ungodly amount used.

Medium to full body, with a coating, resiny, almost syrupy mouthfeel. 

This is a beast! I imagine this is a beer that is very expensive to make, and get why it's not widely distributed at this point. Enjoyed this in the middle of the afternoon on a day with no commitments outside the home, and that's probably for the best! Thank you for getting this to me, Craig! It's one I've long been wanting to try!"

2700,Julius,4.44,"Poured from a can into a teku glass
Appearance – The beer pours a very hazy orange color with a big puffy head of off-white foam. THE head has a great level of retention, fading very slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell -The aroma is big of a musty grainy and bready smell mixed with lots of raw hop aromas of a herbal and earthy nature. There are other citrus aromas of orange and tangerine as well as hints of grapefruit mixed within. Notes of apricot and some grass are in there as well, giving a rather raw and sorta green smell to the brew overall.
Taste – The taste starts out drier than one would anticipate from the nose. It begins with a mix of bready and cracker malt flavors combined with hop flavors of a very potent herbal and grapefruit hop. Notes of a floral and pine hop flavor are there as well, but these tastes are light in comparison to the herbal hop. All the hop flavors are rather “raw” in nature, having an almost hop pellet like flavor associated with them. These potent flavors are the dominant ones throughout much of the taste. While said, there is a decent showing of fruit flavors of tangerine, peach, and apricot, as well as a hint of mango. The mix of sweet, bready and hop take the taste to its end, where it leaves one with a rather green hopped and slightly fruity and malty taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body is a bit more on the creamy and chewy side with a carbonation level that is on the more moderate side. For the rich hop and malt flavors the feel is well done and makes for a nice easy sipper.
Overall – A very nice brew overall. I think I like this better than the King Julius as it is more approachable from my standpoint, but hits all the same high notes as the king variety. Big and flavor and drinkability with a nice blend of hop, malt, and fruit."

Lovely nose of pineapple, mango and assorted citrus... Some light wheat notes linger beneath the surface... Hop presence is more floral and less citrus and reminds me of whole cone fresh hops... Some lemon zest notes as well... Feel is light to medium bodied and a touch thin... Carbonation is minimal... Highly quaffable... Enjoyable and highly recommended but much more muted than I would have expected given the lofty reputation..."
2709,Julius,4.93,
2710,Julius,4.57,"Smell is all ripe mango with a faint hint of peach. Pour is a dark orange, and totally opaque with a small head that dissappates fairly quickly.

A really good beer for sure, bit it may benefit from sitting for a week on the shelf to mellow the upfront astringency some; this one was purchased from the brewery yesterday."

Overall - A wonderfully crafted brew coming in at 6.8% that is the epitome of a hazy, juicy, NE IPA. Right from the start with a juicy, hazy look and strong scent of tropical fruit it just feels like it's gonna be great. Then you hit the first sip and yes it is. Julius lives up to the hype.

Look is a somewhat hazy golden yellow with two fingers of white head. The head has fairly good retention.
Smell is a little below medium in strength. The smell of vanilla is slightly strongest and bfollowed by banana, clove, funk, yeast and a musty smell. It has somewhat of a banana bread smell. The balance in the smell is outstanding but the musty smell lowers it to very good.
Taste is medium-low in strength. The taste follows the nose with the addition of a peppery taste. The flavor is very good. I'm very disappointed how light the flavor is. So, the light flavor makes it good at best.
Feel is medium in thickness. There's barely any creaminess which is extremely unfortunate for this style. Carbonation is medium. It's somewhat dry. The lack of creaminess is unforgivable.
Overall, this beer went down hill and then died with the feel. Hefeweizens are my favorite beer style. After this six-pack, I won't buy this beer again."

Excited to finally be trying the world renowed Trappist Tripel by Westmalle. Acquired at the local Binny's, I've had this sitting in the fridge for a couple of months..

Poured to Piraat stemware.
A: Pours a nicely crisp golden body, deep in color, rich looking. Pillowy finger point five of creamy white frothy head. Good thick ribbons of lacing. Looks excellent for sure.
S: Good creamy aroma. Notes of orchard fruits, apples, pears, leaves.
T: Taste follows, lots of crisp orchard fruits, green apple, pear. Cidery, with a hot alcoholic bite at the end.
F: Feel is a bit thick & heavy. Well-carbonated, but definitely a beer you will want to sip slowly. Alcohol content is hot & boozy, reminiscent of nail polish remover / booze fumes.
Overall, it was fun to try, and I'm definitely interested in trying more authentic trappist made ales, but Tripels are typically not my thing to begin with. The quality of the ingredients shows, but the booziness killed it for me.

2821,Black Note Stout,4.25,"Recording my review from memory. I drank this last night but wasn't able to write it up.

12oz bottle, my friend drank half and gifted the rest of the bottle for me. He had suggested that we drink it together but our schedules didn't match up and he wanted to crack it open. No bottling date. This is the 2017 vintage, so this beer is probably 5 1/2 to 6 years old!

Look: Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with impressive carbonation for a six-year-old bourbon barrel-aged stout. There was a thin brownish-colored head that reduced to a wispy layer. The head regenerates temporarily after swirling the glass.

Smell: Up front, the aromas on this beer (at least at this age) are all umami, all the time. It has that rich, interesting soy sauce note that is blended with dark chocolate and subtle dried fruit aromas. Secondary notes of vanilla and amaretto.

Taste: I am really impressed that this beer has aged so well. I was expecting it to be dull and flat. But it is really smooth, rich, very flavorful. It's also really drinkable and there is basically no heat on the palate. The umami flavor is really nice and then the beer has a nice dark chocolate richness. The beer has subtle sweetness, and the finish is mildly bitter with nice roasted malt character. The amaretto note is also really nice.

Feel: It's not thin and it's not especially thick either. It's somewhere in the middle, I would say that it is medium plus bodied. The mouthfeel is nice with soft carbonation.

Overall: It's very tasty and really enjoyable. I've never had this before. It would be nice to get a fresh batch of this beer and enjoy one every year to see how it develops over time."

Name: Black Note Stout
Brewery: Bell's
Location: Comstock, MI 
Style: Barrel-Aged Imperial Stout
Date: 10/05/2017
This beer has been on my wants for a long time, but I thought I would never get the chance to try it. I was sent this in a box by a fellow beer friend. Using a tulip glass, I served the beer at 52 degrees. The pour created a one in half finger length head with dismal retention. No lacing was left on the glass after the quick dissipation. Charting the color of the beer somewhere around SRM 34, dark brown, nearly black. The appearance is slightly above average, regardless of the head retention. 
Nosing the glass, I detected bourbon, oak, espresso, dark chocolate, cream, oats, raisins, molasses, caramel, toasted bread, dark roasted malts, a hint of char, and a notion of floral. 
Sipping the beer, I taste bourbon, oranges, oak, resin, molasses, milk chocolate, dark coffee, raisins, caramel, toffee, toasted bread crust, oats, a tinge of soy sauce, a hint of Maillard, and a little smoky char. 
The mouthfeel is thick and coated. The body is a medium plus, has low carbonation, and has a delicious finish. 
This beer held up beautifully. I am pleased to have the opportunity to quaff on this stout. Thank you kindly for allowing to have this chance to try a retired beer. Simply a fantastic beer!"

Another BIF beer from @Eziel, and they only retired beer of the lot. This one was quite the highly regarded beer in its time, peaking at roughly #78 overall based on data from the wayback machine. Let's see if it can hold up to the barrel aged Stouts of today

Pours an opaque medium brown with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

Man this packs a boozy punch in the nose for a relatively low 11.2%. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon, black cherry, plum, cocoa pwoder, fruity coffee, toasted oak, light tobacco, and vanilla

It's a bit less fruity and more malt-focused in taste, but still just as good. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black cherry, cocoa powder, caramel, brown sugar, toasted oak, sweet bourbon, vanilla, and lightly burnt coffee. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, burnt coffee, charred oak, cocoa powder, raisin, sweet vanilla, toasted hazelnut, and caramel

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation from the booze, resulting in a rich beer. Finishes surprisingly dry, roasty and balanced by sweeter notes for a shockingly drinkable Stout

Damn, I liked this one more than I had expected to. Even at 6 years old, this is really good. It's too bad they retired this one"
2830,Black Note Stout,4.44,"12oz bottle into a goblet. 2016 release, so 5 years old.

Looks superb in the glass. Jet black body. Generous tan head shrinks to a ring and faint covering, impressive given the abv, and leaves streaks and spots of lacing.

Aroma is wonderfully boozy with a lot of dried dark fruit.

On tasting, so smooth. Boozy, nicely warms the back of the throat. The dried fruit notes add a hint of sweetness. 

The mouth is a bit thinner than you might think, but it still rolls around the tongue beautifully. Finish is a warming smooth booziness, with a faint sweet note.

Overall, delightful sipper of a beer. Been after this one for a while, so thanks to the mighty Sabatinis in Exeter PA for releasing a case from the cellar."

On the pour 3 fingers of fluffy off white head formed on top of a dark reddish brown, and hazy body. Over a couple minutes the head fades to a 0.5cm covering. Sporadic lacing forms.

Aroma is a bit hollow on the first impression. There is a strange almost metallic or mineralic earthiness, before a sweet caramel malt comes though and some nice Belgian yeast spiciness. There is a bit of a funk.

Flavor is very nice with a slight bitterness along with a bready pumpernickel maltiness. The spicy yeast comes in strong with cloves vanilla and cinnamon, not to mention the actual spices that were used during brewing. Then a nice fade into a mellow, sweet, and almost mulled malty finish that is slightly chocolate. The bitterness fades fast.

The feel on this beer is full, but dry, and surprisingly drinkable for the abv. The 8% still makes itself known, but in a friendly relaxing way. Super smooth and cozy. It reminds me of the holidays.

Overall this was a nice surprise. Easy drinking and mellow for this style of beer. Full flavor and cozy comforting maltiness, but no clear alcohol burn make this very nice as a beer after a long day at work."

I’ve always enjoyed this beer fresh and cold, but leaving this beer out and sipping my way through it was great for exposing the beer’s full spectrum of aromas and flavors. This is one of the most inviting beers, if based on looks alone - a beautifully clear deep amber body is capped with a dense light tan head that clings to the glass as it slowly recedes. Note that the last of the crowler poured a bit murkier and more caramel colored than amber. The aromas are initially dominated by a mix of over ripe orchard fruits and darker, sweet, dried fruits on a raisin toast-like malt base. There is a hint of vanilla and a good dose of other oak-barrel, bourbon-like alcohol flavors to stiffly balance this beers rich base. As it warms, there’s nutty/hazelnut, caramel and toffee notes that come forward in the taste. If there’s a moment where the hops shine, it’s mid-finish where they come across as mildly herbal and lightly spicy. Medium to full-bodied with just enough carbonation and abv to keep the beer from coming across as too heavy. I haven’t had many old ales as of late, and the [English] one’s I remember were quite different. Overall, for someone who really likes big, complex, aged ales - this beer is a standout."

2872,Curmudgeon,4.5,"Just about as beautiful a brew can be. A request for a pint came from a tap, in a clear glass vessel. The color is a dark copper, bright, yet not translucent. The head is just barely biege, enduring and contributes to some wonderful glass lacing. The aroma is malty, almost stout-like malty. This is also good inside the mouth. It's rich, sweet, smooth and malty. But that's not all. Molasses and hops bring an earthiness that, without being bitter, enhance what would make a good ale, like a Wee Heavy Scottish Ale. The almost 10% ABV is unnoticed. That it's on the heavy side is a good thing, for any lighter, it would go down too quickly for the overall welfare of its consumer. Overall, complexly excellent."

Nbsoc;
A new generation ‘Miller or Meister Brau,’ when purchased fresh this actually is a great American beer. Aroma and flavor provide some Cascade hop resin and Millennium bittering add a lot of character to this very drinkable beer! A lot of people hunt for ‘dry hopped orange juice’ beer, I personally prefer a hoppy lemon grass flavor, and that comes nicely with this beer. Head starts as a great blossom, good for this style, dissipates sort of fast but does not effect the whole experience, if anything drinking it with head into drinking it with no head is part of what adds a hazy character and some dynamic interest to the glass when drinking a deceivingly simple beer. Minimal malt presence and small noble hop spices draw this style back to a more traditional result, as well as some actually quality feeling wheat, a lot of elements add to the presence and quality of this beer. 

Definitely will drink again, and would recommend for summer gatherings, personal recommendation to anyone just trying to have a good beer without a lot of thought and at a great price point! Tell ‘em Colossal Cascade hops sent ya! Hahahahaa"

500mL bottle (code10.207 2 / 0393 2823) poured into a weizen glass. Pours a beautiful hazy copper-brown color with a ridiculous off-white head and cascading carbonation. Head condenses to a thick rocky pillow of foam that recedes slowly. Big pockets of air develop within the massive head around the sides of the glass; frothy lacing forms in its wake. There's a bright amber glow where the light reflects up from the bottom of the glass, then the beer gets darker as you reach the top. Just a gorgeous beer to behold.

Aroma is overripe bananas, sweet malt, clove and other spices. Nice fruity, floral aroma with a hint of yeast.

Taste is a mouthful of spotty brown bananas, sweet bready malt, raisins, yeast, and spice. This is the definition of mellow. Nice clean mouthfeel that leaves a pleasant sweet aftertaste. The high ABV is hidden extremely well.

On the pour 2 fingers of off white to tan head that became rocky and a bit foamy over a few minutes, until finally settling at a decent tan cap. Body is a dark amber to copper, with a bit of haze, but light still comes through.

Aroma carries sweet fig and toffee/caramel, but there is a slight savory oxidation thing going on. Alcohol isnoticeable, but not boozy.

Taste follows the sweet malty notes, but loses the off notes. I'm going to blame the aroma on bottle age, which for now is unfortunately uncontrollable. Traditional banana hefeweizen flavor comes through with a sweet caramelized flavor coming from the malts. Honestly very easy to drink and comes off as a Dunkelweizen to my untrained American palate. Still there is some light figgy fruit going on but this is mostly a very enjoyable dark, strong, traditional tasting hefeweizen. Nice balancing hop bitterness, but no hop aromas.


Feel is smooth and easy drinking. This beer hides its ABV well once it's on your palate. Slight astringency, but this isn't a dry beer. At the same time this beer doesn't come off as huge and thick. The astringency balances the malt well leading to the easy drinking feel of this. Medium long finish, but it's subtle. Soft subtle, but present, carbonation.

Overall there are flaws, but this is one of my favorite general doppelbock style beers I've ever had, although, it is the only weizen-doppelbock I've tried. Nice traditional hefeweizen flavor merged with delicious caramel sweet malts, as well as a nice balancing bitterness. Smells a bit funny when it gets old though."

2931,2XIPA,3.96,"Rich and coppery in color, 2-finger head. Great lacing; made a little heart shape in the pint glass, which is completely coincidential and your mileage may vary, but still a nice little moment for me. Smells citrusy-pineappley. The flavor is hop-forward and floral, with strong pine notes. I've noticed a lot of popular IIPAs going in a very malty direction that I am not personally a big fan of. This does not do that; up to you whether that's a good thing. Unremarkable mouthfeel. Medium bodied and very carbonated. 

I'm happy as a clam. A definite favorite for me from an otherwise ""Eh, But Drinkable"" variety pack, and very good in its own right."
2932,2XIPA,4.08,"12oz can dated ""best by 02/28/23"" poured into a pint glass shows a cloudy, gold body and boasts a proud 2"" head of lovely white fluffy bubbles that leaves a solid drape of lacing on the glass from top to bottom.

Aromas of grapefruit and pine resin match the flavor, which also includes a strong biscuit malt. A bitter residue remains behind.

Feel is full, well carbonated being just short of sharp, and not quite sticky.

Overall a classic double."

2939,2XIPA,3.36,"Smells great, looks good, feels great. not my favorite double ipa. the ABV comes through too strong on this one and the alcohol overpowers the hops/floral/citrus/pine. dogfish 90min, great lakes chillwave, double dale's are all preferable over this."

A - cloudy body of golden amber under a finger of off white foam

T - big citrus (mainly pink grapefruit), bitter floral notes, a little pine, peppery spice, quite fruity, heavy malt backbone (but the bitterness never lets up); bitter, complex, and enjoyable!

M - bitterness bites all the way through, smooth full body, average carbonation

O - an excellent DIPA from Surly!"

2942,Abrasive Ale,4.4,"(16 oz can, canned on 11/18/22, F5670; purchased 4-pack off shelf at Shangy's... poured into a fat tulip)

L: slightly-hazy medium amber-colored liquid; not a huge head on the pour, but it's tight with a frayed cotton contour... only holds a thin collar, thin misty cap; does leave a big band of lace oppo of sip spot

S: very floral initial pop (rosewater), followed by some fleshy orange pulp, lemon/grapefruit zest, background hint of pine... a little honeyish malt wants to poke through... gummy orange slices... only a soft essence of alcohol... excellent overall intensity

T: citrus kiss, but a rush of florality right behind it... the aftertaste is spicy, with a green bitterness that slowly swells... certainly a big malty base, with a muffin/cakey quality, but it's sodden with hop resins... vague dried pale-colored fruit (apricot, sultana) slowly creeps into the aftertaste, while the residual bitterness grows some peppery hair to it... the volume on the bitterness just keeps increasing, speakers cracking and shaking; hop artifacts emerge

F: its bitter bite takes hold on the tongue, mildly intensified by the ethanol, which sets and singes (and yet cools?!) a touch near the back of the palate... its body and resins make for a silky lusciousness up front, giving way to a growing heat; soft carbonation

O: why did this take so long to be released out east here(?), especially considering Furious had been here for years now; this was the first Surly beer I ever heard of c. 2011 (though Darkness and Bender weren't far behind)... I am going to try the next can in a pint, which they're website suggests is the preferred vessel... aggressive and comforting (2081)"

2944,Abrasive Ale,4.85,"I am so happy to have finally found this locally (PA) after searching for it for years. It did not disappoint. While the can is over a couple of months old, the ale still tasted very fresh. I rate it as having a NE flavor profile while having a west coast appearance. It is translucent and golden, but definitely not cloudy. The head was white and not too foamy. The aromas came in waves of sweet fruit. The flavor came in waves and it seemed each one was a different type of tropical fruit. What a fantastic drinking experience. The only downside was the $5 price tag, but that would be a bargain in a tavern."

Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy (80% clarity) medium orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 9. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of rich grapefruit, tropical mango and melon. Resinous, earthy, and tropical. Some tropical peach evolves as it warms. (4.25) 

Flavor: Flavors follow the nose with strong tropical grapefruit, pineaple, mango/melon with a sweet peach undertone. A moderate balance of sweet and smooth caramel balanced by bitter pine notes. (4.25)

Feel: Heavier bodied, strong carbonation and finishes sweet, but surprisingly clean and drinkable on the palate. (4.25) 

Compared to Revolution Anti-Hero IPA 12/2022: Pours lighter, stronger aromas. More juicy grapefruit, tropical pineapple, melon, and peaches. Less resinous nectarine and syrup. Juicier, but also more balanced with pine bitterness. Winner: Surly

Compared to Surly Axe Man 2/2023: Pours darker, hazier. Stronger aromas. More sweet and juicy tangerine and peach. Less dank berry and pine notes. 

Overall: Wow a surprisingly fantastic IPA here. Grapefruit, tropical pineapple, mango/melon, and peach flavors. Juicy with enough pine and grapefruit citrus rind to balance. Beldns NEIPA juicy flavors with west-coast body and mouthfeel. Sort of reminds me of Half Acres IPA blends and not unlike Axe Man in many ways. (Rating: 4.24)"

Surly Brewing
Imperial IPA
Date: 17 Dec 2021
Another beer that I have wanted to be marked off my list. The beer is 46 degrees, and I used a tulip glass. A frothy and airy two-fingered bright white head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, deep golden yellow. Clarity is brilliant, with a few carbonation bubbles dancing within. The appearance of the beer is excellent. 
Ripe grapefruit and juicy melon are what I immediately pick up. Smelling beer again, I detect pine, bready, yeasty, honey-like sweetness, oranges, floral esters, and herbal. 
Interesting, I get pineapple, mango, grapefruit, floral, and herbal notes from the first sip. Taking another, I taste bread dough, oranges, pine, lightly toasted malts, pharmaceutical, and a touch of dank. 
The mouthfeel is sticky, sweet, and coating. The body is medium, the carbonation is low, and the finish lingers. 
This is not what I was expecting for this beer. The malts are heavy and drown out the hops. The hop profiles are unique in is own way. I was expecting something like a WCIPA and got a hybrid. I would not say this beer is abrasive. When I think of an abrasive beer, I think of Ruination, the first one, not this newer crap. The beer is okay; nothing special stands out as amazing."

Very drinkable with just enough body to balance the bitterness, with a low creaminess so as not to be coating on the palate. Not my favorite style, but when compared to the style requirements, its almost as if they the style was written based on this beer. Regardless, I can't rate it a five just yet. 4.25

A – Pours a clear but opaque black in the glass with red highlights with a three-finger frothy light tan head that slowly dissipates. 4.5

S – Dry and roasty, nothing burnt, sweet, nor coffee. Some very minor dark chocolate. 4.0

T – Roasty malt but dominated by a dry almost burnt hoppy bitterness. No sweetness or hop flavors. 4.25

MF – Medium light body with a dry, almost astringent finish. Not creamy in my opinion (but not a nitro pour). 4.0"

2970,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.85,"Aye, tis be a fine day fer da post o' Stout. Ye shall recant a purvew o' the generalities o' Blighty's and Ireland's lovely brew.

Enough proofy, prothy, wonky, and cobblygoobly talk. Here we go.

The look: Onyx. 

The Smell: At times the scent of dark malted barley (literally) and coco nibs. 

Taste: When traveling the exhausting terrain of Tralfamadore, my senses were heightened. Ever since then every beer tastes precisely the same, except a traditional stout. A lovely biscuit, dark chocolate, and roasty veggies would pair well. The brew itself, roasty and slightly bitter (not the style).

Feel: Completely devoid of human interaction I found the comfort in the only beverage available to humans. A ""Toutshsawgoh"". The first sip of this threw me into a stupor. My mouth felt a cozy, forthy, and welcoming presence to these parched lips.

Overall: For every action, there must always be an equal and opposite reaction... so said the doctor. Gallifrey mustn't have any porters or stouts, since this brew allows bipedal individuals to time travel just to taste it. This traditional stout is a classic and can still manage to transmit alienlike messages to our inner selves just to show us... it rocks."

2975,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.67,"Have had before but first time reviewing

Allowed to acclimate to room temperature for 15 minutes and poured into a tulip pint glass (not a tulip glass).

Pours black (I've read Guinness is actually very dark red) with beautiful dark amber mixing with red hints around the edges, with a 3 finger khaki head with foam that remains like seafoam when the head dissipates.

Initial aroma is slightly metallic, followed by light olive green hoppy and dark tan bitter smells. Smells almost as if it doesn't have much body.

Initial taste is bitter and a little sour, followed by malty, as well as slightly reminiscent of purple grape soda, when this mixes with the bitterness it's a little like grape medicine, but not unpleasant at all. More bitter in the aftertaste mixing with cocoa that lingers on the back of the tongue and the back of the roof of the mouth. It's dry throughout the entire tasting process, as you would expect an Irish dry stout to be. As I get more than halfway through I notice a note of molasses, as well as a general sweetness throughout in addition to the bitterness.

Mouthfeel is richer than average, overall smooth, it goes down very easily and I have zero complaints about it, but unfortunately I struggle to find any ways to describe what the carbonation does in the mouth or how it sits on the tongue.

Will buy again at some point, but were it not attached to the Guinness name I don't know if I would and I find myself leaning towards not. Overall a solid beer."
2976,Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.24,"It's been a while since I've had this and it is much better than I remember. Nice depth of flavor and I'd say a superior beer to the draught (or at least the draught in a can).

I'm getting an aroma primarily of malt and chocolate sweetness, which is what hits first on the taste as well. It then progresses with a wave of roast and a balancing bitterness (semi-dark chocolate and char) that nicely offsets the sweetness. On the finish and aftertaste there is a slight addition of dark fruit. Medium bodied and moderate carbonation."

2982,Hop Rod Rye,4.19,"Bottle poured into a Bear Republic Brewing Co pint glass

A: Pours copper brown amber with a frothy tan head that settles to a firm layer and laces nicely.

S: Toasty bready malt, rye spice, earthy, herbal, pine, floral notes, light citrus, faint hints of dark fruit, and a little toffee sweetness. 

T: Peppery rye right up front, toasty bready malt, spicy pine, floral notes, underlying citrus, grapefruit lemon, and orange, earthy, green herbal notes, hints of dark fruit, and toffee sweetness. 

M: Just a touch on the fuller side of medium body, moderate carbonation. Deceptively smooth for an 8%er. 

O: Could have sworn I reviewed this one at some point, but I'm glad I was able to snap some up. Definitely a piece of NorCal brewing history. Excellent Rye IPA!"
2983,Hop Rod Rye,4.11,"16oz can poured into a New Belgium globe.

A: Dark ruby red color with lighter orange hues. Super healthy head formation and retention. A solid two and a half fingers of cream-coloered head stick around for the duration and leave behind gobs of chunky lacing in a loose ring formation.

S: Juiced ruby red grapefruit, pine and resin, green and spicy hop oils. Underlying malt toastiness, sharper earthy rye spice, and a distinct crystal malt sweetness that brings a touch or berry/candy shell. Clean fermentation profile, probably chico yeast. 

T: Opens with a fat crystal malt sweetness. Caramel, toffee, and candy shell. This very quickly gives way to a drying blanket of toastiness, flashes of burnt crust, and a lot of spicy rye. Hop profile hits hard and fast with a lot of vibrant and bitter ruby red grapefruit juice. Butter line and resin too, along with an oily and green spiciness. Bitterness is quite firm. The finish dries quite a bit with long lingering rye spice, oily hop bitterness, and traces of soot. 

M: Full bodied with some chewiness and a very round and creamy malt texture. Plenty of raking hop astringency too. Ample carbonation scrubs firmly.

O: What a throwback. I do think this is the first rye IPA I ever had, circa 2008, but I can't remember ever revisiting it before today. I do miss rye beer in general, and feel like it got unfairly buried under the sea of west coast and hazy IPAs. This particular beer is considered a venerable classic within the rye sub-styles, and deservedly so. I love what they've done with the hop profile: the rye is unabashedly bold, and there's some interesting specialty malt character to round things out and create just enough balance to ground the bitterness and spiciness. Drinking it bakes me feel like I pulled something special out of the beer archives, but in this case I didn't have to blow any dust off of it because it was nice and fresh at my local packie."

Aroma is hop forward earthy, floral, grapefruit, pine with a fruity hint, rye bread and rye spice.

Smell is lightly boozy upfront, quickly overtaken by the creaminess - big lactose, really has that creamy aroma, some backing chocolate and roast. 

Taste is similar but the booziness is a backing flavor: big cream, lactose, lighter chocolate, some roast, booze. Flavor really emanates a thick cocktail like flavor. 

Mouthfeel is low nitro effervescence, strong/thick creamy sweetness, limited bitterness and even limited drying from the strength. 

Overall a big, creamy sweet brew that gives off a creamy cocktail vibe (white russian-esque)."
3023,Crème Brûlée,3.84,"This is just sweeter than the hot cocoa one but that's really about the whole super prevalent difference. I feel like trying this one made me like them both a little less. Sweet, boozy, run of the mill. Southern Tier is super overrated as a whole to me. There's great desert beers and pastry stouts everywhere. Try something new. I will say this shits on their ipas in the since these are better at being stouts than the ipas are at being ipas. At least this is supposed to be sweet."
3024,Crème Brûlée,4.62,"Experience says that this is among the best of the desert beers. Now it's time for a critical review. Two twelve ounce cans are opened and all of the contents of one and most of the contents of the second can are fitted instead a clear glass Imperial pint mug. There's an amazing vanilla smell in the air and the beige head, preventing the entire drainage of the second can, is one of the tightest and enduring in the beer world. It adorns a beautiful black coffee colored liquid that's opaque, but reasonably bright. Behind the sharp vanilla nose hit, found is creamy sweetness, kind of like the smell gotten from an aerosol whipped cream. For its color, there's very little reference to roasted malt. There is some roasted malt bitterness in the taste. So much so that it detracts from the intended target. But, it's a mild infraction, as there's enough smooth and creamy character to carry most of the taste. Actually the stout bitterness doesn't really kick until the finish. Until then, this is an amazing liquid reminder of a pleasantly sweet desert, without the crusty covering. There's great glass lacing and a well disguised 10% ABV. Maybe not perfect, but this is one great desert beer."

The sweet flavour is first and foremost crème brûlée again, but also roasty notes of strong coffee, dark bitter chocolate and liquorice. Also some hoppy bitterness in the finish. Warming mouthfeel.

Smell and Taste: This beer really does resemble Creme Brûlée. Vanilla, and burnt sugar on cream. Great combination. 
Feel: Nitro makes it smooth and soft.
Overall: This its one of the easiest beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Bumped the OA score down some because of the short pour. Should have ben packaged in a can the size of a pint.

Nose is seriously sweet with caramel, brown sugar, sweet cream and vanilla bean.

Flavor begins with caramel and vanilla, roasted coffee flavor comes on to offer some balance. Boozy alcohol warmth plays in the background the whole time.

Finish leans toward the bitter from the coffee, the sweetness and alcohol warmth are still there though.

Viscous body and subtle carbonation let this one hang on the palate a little, but it’s a desert beer in every way, so this wasn’t surprising.

Not a daily drinker, good to keep a few on hand for the colder months though."

Looks great, yellow, slight haze. Smells like a Belgian but with a fruity edge. Tastes much better when poured out. I don't really taste the orange peel, but lots of coriander and Belgian yeast flavor. A lemon tang and silky smooth yeasty goodness. Still not a fan of Goose Island's Belgian stuff. 

Baby's first Belgian"

3086,Sofie,4.07,"On tap at the Clybourne brewpub

Next stop, Goose Island. Continuing on with my Chicago beer escapade, I just had to stop at this legendary brewery for some good beers here and to go. Let’s see what their classic Saision is all about

Pours a cloudy yellow gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

There’s not much funk or tartness to the nose as I tend to prefer in the style, but the earthy vibe is still quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of white pepper, lemon zest, white tea, crackery malt, tannic white wine, wildflower honey, pear skin, and earthy wheat

Likewise in taste it is more just straight earth than funk, and again still good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, wildflower honey, white tea, peppery hops, apple skin, and light toast. The swallow brings notes of clove, bready malt, white grape, honey, peppery hops, pear skin, and a touch of vanilla

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp and sharp beer. Finishes mostly dry and refreshing

This is a nice, well rounded Saison. Nothing to seek out but good nonetheless"
3087,Sofie,4.06,
3088,Sofie,3.98,"Fairly light with a touch of funkiness and bitterness. More bitter than I expected, but that may also be the citrus peel. Excellent aroma."

3090,Sofie,4.02,"This is a 12oz. bottle, poured into the Goose Island pint glass. This brew is slightly hazy, a light yellow with a slight orange tint when held up to the light. There is an abundant amount of carbonation to watch parade to the top. The half inch of fluffy white head did recede to a thin cap after several minutes.
The aroma is quite noticeable from a distance. For starters there is a sweet fruity citrus, I am leaning toward notes of orange. There is a pleasant yeast and wheat mixture happening also.
The wheat is the first thing I am picking up, a little yeast, then the orange peel. The finish is slightly bitter, a tad dry, with a bump of pepper spice.
This is an easy drinker, not heavy, a medium smooth feel."

3097,Sofie,3.12,"A Saison found the day after Saison Day. Better late, but unfortunately, this was the only one available. Two brown twelve ounce bottles have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. It's a light amber liquid, really not much different in color than most lagers. There is a bit more opaqueness than lagers generally have. A nice modest and enduring white head is included. The glass lacing is even less. The smell is vaguely yeasty and perhaps a little perfume-llke. The taste is yeasty and perfume-llke, but mildly refreshing. It certainly is much lighter in feeling and taste than an IPA. Not everyone will appreciate that as a good thing. Orange peel is included in the mix. It's there, but not a heavy influence on the taste. Probably it adds to a dry bitterness that shows at the finish. That part is well done, for without it, this could be a yeasty mess. There's no evidence this has an ABV above five percent other than to read it on the label. Probably average for the style, this isn't going to convert a hop loving DIPA devotee. Yet, for a once a year change, it wasn't such a terrible thing."

3101,Kalamazoo Stout,3.83,"Bottled on 6.15.20

Poured at fridge temp (and will let warm up) into a tulip glass.

Pours a deep inky brown with a one finger sandy head - settles into about a 1/2 finger ultra tightly bubbled ring and a loose cap. 4

At fridge-ish temp I get some chocolate and associated sweetness and some malty body. though I do get that rich black licorice taking a whiff off the bottle. Coffee roast aromas begin to rise as it warms up. 4

Roasted coffee, dull but spicy hop presence and a hint of that black licorice offer a nice and pleasing if not unexpected flavor. 3.75

Light prickling carbo, but otherwise a lighter body for a stout with nice lingering aftertaste and smooth finish. 3.75

Overall a fairly 'sessionable' stout that is less filling than a nitro(good thing here) and was impressive stand-alone though I'd imagine pairs great with the right meal. 3.75"
3102,Kalamazoo Stout,3.64,"Very dark brown with kakhi foam. Smell is dark roasted malts. Flat and thin, but mostly pleasant to sip on otherwise. It packs a lot of flavor into 6%, neither too bitter or too sweet, but the hop and licorice combined leaves a sorta funky aftertaste"

3113,Kalamazoo Stout,3.98,"Somehow, Kalamazoo Stout is not among the 15 I've had previously from Bell's. I've always like Bell's and probably have not written a micro-review since the announced purchase by Kirin interests a year ago. I suppose I was waiting for something to happen; but the purchase seems not to have changed Bell's. And this is a very good thing because Bell's epitomized how crafters centered in and served their communities. It actually seems to provide purpose to growth over time. Bells did and as it grew it took on new responsibilities, most recently sustainability and DEI. I hope that continues and it is why I still give Bell's very good Overall Hugs.

As for Kalamazoo... This follows the principle that if you don't try to do too much at first, it improves your chances of eventually becoming a classic. Many American stouts fell off the extreme edge, but Kalamazoo continues. And transcending the its strong licorice, my taste memory said: ""I've had this stout before, haven't I?"" I suppose I have; but it was not brewed by Bell's. It was brewed by a micro imitating and inspired by Kalamazoo. And that is what makes Kalamazoo a classic. Cheers !"

IBU: 65
Creamy, light tan head. Very dark chestnut, that appears almost on the border of black, for the appearance. Co-mingling of pine, grapefruit peel, with the lightest touch of medium dark roasted malt, rounding out the aroma. A touch sweet, mild grapefruit peel, pine and ample malt, for the taste."
3121,Wookey Jack,4.38,"12oz can, about 3 months old

Pours over two fingers of fluffy brown head into my snifter. Retention is amazing, after a solid few minutes there is still a sturdy finger of head. Lacing is perfect. Body is pitch black, even when held to the light. Looks magnificent.

Nose is very spicey, paired with a full dose of fresh baked bread. Almost a candy sweetness, but it doesn’t come across gross at all. Smells fantastic.

You get that rye in full force on the flavor, they really didn’t hold back here and I love it - rye is often hard for me to pick up. You also get some of that breadiness, the roast doesn’t come out until it gets a good while to warm. The black characteristics aren’t huge, but there is a deep maltiness that borders on molasses - it’s not gross or out of place at all. This might be a touch old, maybe that’s why some sweetness is coming out, but it’s aged quite well and has a nice smoothness once the eccentric spice passes - both being welcome.

Carbonation is medium-low. Has a somewhat heavy body that is just the slightest bit cloying - some sugars are present, but mostly subdued by the substantial spice and moderate bitterness. A lovely mouthfeel.

The drinkability is phenomenal, especially for a beer at this ABV, with this much going on. Neither the sugar, nor the spice slow me down one bit.

A lovely little beer that starts with a hoppy rye kick, and transitions to a smoother darker offering."

3124,Wookey Jack,4.25,"12oz can, wine glass, canned 12/22/22. 

Wookey resembles an imperial stout; no highlights and a magnificent cappuccino head. 

Christmas tree, peppermint patty, lavender. There are layers of chocolate behind all the pine and herbal hops. 

Malted milk balls and almost a milk stout richness, though much more bitter and hopped than you’d find with that style. The pine returns in the backend, accompanied by more floral flavors like lavender and lilac, and earthy rye. 

Creamy medium body, medium carbonation. It’s silky but balanced. 

Definitely a good Black IPA with strong and interesting hopping."
3125,Wookey Jack,4.22,"About pitch black with a robust sticky deep tan head. 
Nose is a pleasant blend of hood and malt/ caramel. 
Taste is like a toasted, charry beer that happens to have hops in there, like a dark pine forest. It all works, somehow. I never seek dark IPAs but made an exception when I saw this and having heard of how good it is. Toasted rye and tingly hops, slight hints of sweetness, maybe some coffee, but this is mostly an earthy beer. 
Feels medium- full and silky smooth yet with good carbonation. 
This surprised me a bit. Not my style, but this is just a very well-made beer. Don’t expect complexity or many different discernible flavors. This is mostly about crafting balance to a simple yet flavorful conclusion. Going forward if I ever try another “black IPA”, WJ is the beer to which it’ll be measured."

Big nose of leafy and earthy hops (I'd never place Citra and Amarillo) backed up solidly by roasty, and also earthy malts. Hint of menthol and coffee in a complex swirl of aromas. Flavors of mild citrus, lemon, and bitter/spicy malt. Medium (bright) body and carbonation, substantial bitter punch and a long, roasty and hoppy finish. Outstanding."

This is one of the best in the Black IPA category and the rye addition makes it great IMO and I admit that rye beers are usually my jam so take that for what it’s worth and a great beer, cheers!"
3132,Wookey Jack,4.49,"Dark as a stout with a large tan head and very good lacing. Complex aroma. Not just the smokey, roasted malts but also licorice, dried fruit, pine and herbal hops. Taste keeps pushing the envelope as well. The resinous base pairs with the solid array of malts, especially the rye. The focus shifts with each sip and cannot be easily pigeonholed. Full bodied but not heavy. Bitter but not palate numbing. A good alcohol bite but not head spinning. Overall, it's not just about balance but how everything comes together"

Poured very dark brown (black with dark brown edges) and had a *very* ambitious beige head which left sheets of lacing.
The aroma, to my damaged nose, was coffeeish with a vegetable/plant like accent. Wet hay maybe? I figured I was smelling it wrong as I generally don't smell much at all.
The taste was at first brash and harsh; all the bite of the roasted rye and copious hops were dominant. As it warmed the malts came out to play with rye bread and roasted grains, with almost a sweetness at times. The coffee and hops definitely shine the brightest, but are well supported by the other ingredients.
The feel was lively due to the carbonation, added to the bite I enjoy so much in rye beers especially, didn't distract from the sweeter aspects though. Well done.
OA, Very glad to have been able to try this, outstanding beer."
3138,Wookey Jack,4.4,"Was so happy to hear that this beer was available again. Found that the Thistle Draftshop had it on draft and the family went with me on MLK day!

Poured from tap into a tulip glass. Beautiful black color with excellent head and curtain lacing. Smell and taste of citrus, pine and roasted malt. Lime and dark pumpernickel toast. Wonderful bitter finish and rich, full feel. Hoped they had cans, but still on the lookout!"

Thought OK smell isn’t great but taste had to be better. NOPE! As bad as I didn’t like the smell I liked that more than the taste.

Bright acidity balanced with medium carbonation make this beautiful palette cleansing opener. Bright cherry and balsamic vinegar on the nose wish a dash of barnyard funk. Tart cherry notes evolve into a sweet (but not overly so) balsamic vinegar finish that just begs for another sip. Those who resist will enjoy the long, lavish finish. 
Enjoy with wild game or short ribs.

This serving was drawn from a tap and presented in a clear pint glass. On top lays the most marginal of heads that's sort of biege. It brings those Belgian smells of yeast, malt, alcohol and some hops. The initial taste is a sweet and sour blast, more sweet until, as it finishes, a vinegar-like presence is detected. It's an enjoyable transition. Overall, this is malty big, with not much bite from the hops. That makes the sourness even more appreciated. There's much less alcohol to taste as there was in the aroma. Thankfully, the oak tannins don't turn this into something that tastes like a boilermaker. Even without a head, nor glass lacing, this looks good, especially since it went down so rich and smoothly. Perhaps it will take having a sweet tooth to love this one."

3154,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.33,"Dark ruby red on the eyes and red wine vinegar on the nose. Full of fruit flavor dominated by cherry. It is both funky/sour and sweet with neither overpowering the other. Medium carbonation and feels like a wine, although maybe my mouth is influenced by my eyes. Very good, I would have one again."
3155,Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.03,"Look: deep reddish brown with a beautifully thick, cream-colored head. 

Smell: I’m immediately reminded of red wine vinegar, but not in a bad way. Oak and some sort of red berry, with a distinct musty funk (again, not in a bad way). 

Taste: an elegant mix of sweet and sour, but not overall as complex as the nose. No real fruit in the taste, and not much funk beyond the general sour nature of the style. 

Feel: more carbonated than expected. Thin but not watery. 

Overall: one of the most wine-like beers I’ve ever tried. I come to this after already trying the sour cherry variant, and while I miss the cherries in this version it’s still an excellent beer and one of the defining examples of its style."

Look - Deep dark amber, kind of a root beer color. Gorgeous shade. Head is fluffy, billowing with life, a bright cap on the mellow body. A very attractive looking beer, could be a hair darker though.

Smell - Fairly weak. Initial note is just metallic, but some toasted grains poke through after a bit. No real vanilla or anything though.

Taste - Vanilla and milk chocolate. Doesn't even register as a beer really, more of some kind of dessert drink. It's not obnoxious or in-your-face though, it's got a bit of class and sophistication.

Feel - A bit too thin-bodied for how I typically enjoy my dark beers. Could do with a bit more sparkle and pep as well.

Appearance: Hazy golden yellow with a rocky head of sudsy white bubbles and clumpy lace.

Smell: Straw, hay, black pepper, cloves and slight banana on the nose.

Taste: Straw, hop and yeast spice continue atop a clean malt base with subtle grain sweetness, refined bitterness and a crisp, dry finish.

Mouthfeel: Light body filled out by lively carbonation.

Overall: At once refreshing and drinkable while also deeply complex and characterful."
3201,Saison Dupont,4.44,"11.2 oz bottle poured into a chalice glass. Hazy blonde color with big white head that lasts for a while. Smell is a bit funky, hay, green apple, spicy hop.

Nose: Not unpleasant earthy alcohol, a bit of citrus.

Mouthfeel: Medium, with plenty of carbonation.

Attack: Follows the nose, with the addition of malt that’s between bread and biscuit.

Finish: Just enough hop bitterness to balance.

Mostly clear, pale gold colored body. One thick finger of white head, but this retreats quickly to a puffy cap and ring. Leaves behind partial walls of lacing.
Aroma is as advertised with pine, citrus, and a true note of cedar.
Taste has a solid malt base over which hops express flavors of generic citrus and pine. Sweet and woody cedar also. Slight bitterness picks up in the aftertaste.
Medium mouth feel, with a drying aspect. Very good carbonation.
Savors as a classic IPA in the West Coast style."
3224,Duet,4.07,"Pour deep yellowish-orange with a white head that lingers long. Smells mildly of pine and citrus. Tastes heavily of hops, but delicately balanced with sugar sweetness. Mouthfeel is dry and a tad too bitter. Overall, a beer that should be a IPA standard."

3228,Duet,6.39,
3229,Duet,3.71,"This episode involved emptying two twelve ounce cans into a clear glass liter mug. The pours produced an overabundance of white foam on the top of a bright and light amber liquid. This one is about as translucent as any beer with a reasonable color can get. The aroma is mostly of hops, resinous and piney in character. It's not particularly rich. There's much less hop bite to taste than expected. What is there mixes poorly with whatever starch combination was used. There's an unpleasant, almost soapiness to taste until the finish. At least then, the Simcoe hops kick in and provide some clean and dry bitterness. All that foam and no glass lacing bears witness that this is short on body for an alleged IPA. On a positive note, the 7% ABV is nicely delivered. That should complete the compliments."
3230,Duet,5.0,
3231,Duet,3.82,"Appearance: Pours a hazy, orange-yellow body with a modestly-sized, foamy, white head. Light lacing.

Smell: Pulped citrus supremes, pith powder, stonefruit juices, an unctuous drizzle of pine sap and a grassy herbaceousness.

Taste: Kicks of with a lean, light biscuit-innards maltiness, with things going pretty dry and pretty bitter quickly. Pithy citrus, a charged grassy element and a touch of PNW pine resin rounded everso slightly by pineapple and peach. Staunchly bitter making for a nigh austerely dry, potently bitter finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Not bad."
3232,Duet,4.03,"Golden orange with chill haze and a one finger white head. Nose is orange, tangerine, and some sugar. Taste follows the nose with a nice bite of grapefruit, orange, and tangerine pith and flesh followed by a short hint of pale malt. Body is light to medium with similar carbonation. Ends with a bitter citrus nuttiness. Overall not a bright as I thought it would be but solid characteristics. Maybe an older can? Cans says best by 12/22/22 and I’m opening it 9/2/22. Not sure how old it is?"
3233,Duet,4.59,"A well balanced citrusy IPA with a mixture of Pine and cedar notes. Displays a lighter orange color with nice head and nice citrus aromas. From the first sip you can taste the citrus, which was soon followed by the pine. This beer paired well on a warm day and was easily followed by a second. Exactly what I remembered from a west coast IPA."

3235,Duet,4.21,
3236,Duet,4.14,"Really solid beer. I had this one a few years back - it seems a bit different from what I remember or just what I expected in a West Coast IPA, but really a great beer. I have rounded my 'overall' up since my lower scores are probably more of a personal preference vs. a fault with the beer. I downgraded in the look and feel dept - looking ('hazy') and feeling ('juicy') like a NEIPA is not a positive for me. I was hoping for a crisper feel and clearer look. Nonetheless, I loved the foamy pour, the piney smell, and a real nice level of maltiness that tames the hoppy-ness. There's no doubt I would have this again."
3237,Duet,4.36,
3238,Duet,4.38,"Old school West Coast IPA. Piney and bitter with some citrus elements, backed up by a silky, full mouthfeel. Pours a bright coppery orange with a thin, persistent head. It's possibly being overrated here due to the pleasure of drinking an actual West Coast IPA and the sentimentality of a beer style that first introduced me to craft beer (and which I forced down in horror at the hoppy bitterness of it all!).

Cheers"
3239,Duet,3.7,Very piney full ipa. Stronger flavor than most. Too much of a piney after taste for my liking. 1 is enough. All around the taste is good strong but the aftertaste is what lessens the score for me. I am a bigger fan of the Nelson and og lemon haze styles.

3302,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.04,
3303,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.53,"Pours out of the can a midnight black-brown, no light passes through it. A nice 2 fingers of tan head with great retention. Smells of cocoa, coffee, and roasty malts. Taste follows the nose fairly well with the coffee being the predominant flavor and the rich mouth feel is like velvet. The beer has a perfect carbonation for the style that achieves this sensation. I'm really glad I bought a four pack!"
3304,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.43,"In this rendition, it's a pint can emptied into a clear Imperial pint glass. The entire contents fit almost perfectly, as there's no extraordinary foam, just a modest and enduring dark biege head. The color of the liquid is the standard black coffee brown, no more, no less. Although the aroma is less than pungent, there is some roasted barley to be had, but the almond and vanilla additions just don't impress the nose. But, what a wonderful drink! There's the sweet malt of a great stout upfront, delivered within an incredibly rich body. Now the nuances: There's coffee, but it's not overly bitter, nor the dominating taste it can be, even in good coffee stouts. The vanilla only slightly sweetens the brew, but contributes as an extra layer, not a major taste emphasis. Almond inclusion adds body and another taste layer, without changing the overall and likely adds even more body to a brew certainly not lacking thereof. It's hard pressed to find a richer bodied stout than this one. Maybe there's not great glass lacing, but other than that, this is one of the best 10+% ABV brews out there. The alcohol is warming for sure, but not harsh and barely noticeable to taste. This is a great member of its style."
3305,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.47,"L: Poured from a pint can into a sniffer - inky jet black pour with a huge head risen. About 3 fingers length to be exact.
S: Getting predominant aromas for vanilla, along side with molasses, slight roasty coffee, chocolate and malt aromas. Not getting much of the almond in this.
T: Getting a complexed mix of vanilla, chocolate, roasty coffee. You can taste the biscuit more so near the after taste of it all. Getting some after tastes of velvet as well. Almost similar to a chili brewed stout after taste to this.
F: Heavy bodied, alcohol hides very well. Sipper but easy to sip. The taste is so smooth and tasty, it reminds me of a stout I had that had chili peppers brewed into it.
O: This is a great stout for the price given. Honestly it's complexed but is very rich and easy to drink. This one I'll be buying again in the near future."
3306,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.46,"I tried a 10oz glass of this beer off the tapper at Dry Ground Brewing as a guest tap in Paducah, Kentucky. It poured an opaque dark with thin tan head that did not leave much lace. The scent had dark chocolate and gram cracker notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip. There was dark chocolate roast malt and biscotti cookie presence. The mouthfeel was fuller in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer."

3308,Imperial Biscotti Break,4.35,"Pours a dark brown with a small tan cap and light lacing.

Tastes of sweet, toasted malt, bitter coffee and a bit of caramel and vanilla. The finish is slightly bitter and very boozy warm.

3320,Head Hunter,3.75,
3321,Head Hunter,4.23,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.99 plus tax. Canned on 05/15/23, so this beer is almost three months old.

Look: It has a nice orange gold color with a half finger of beige colored head. The beer is fairly clear, however it is unfiltered and there is a slight haziness / chill haze.

Smell: Lots of resinous pine and citrus (grapefruit and orange) notes. Also dried pineapple. This smells really nice, I wouldn't mind wearing fragrance that smelled like this. There's a subtle darker biscuit malt underneath all of the hops. Spicy notes along with some paint thinner. Subtle green bell pepper on the finish. More fruitiness comes through on the nose as I get into it and as the beer warms up. I ultimately get a nice, sweet cantaloupe note along with lots of orange zest.

Taste: Ooooh, this is seriously intense! They weren't kidding when they said ""aggressively hopped West-Coast IPA""! It has a bit of that enamel-stripping character that scares you at first and then ultimately endears you. I's actually really nice and while it is very bitter on the finish, it still has very clean flavors on the palate and the bitterness doesn't linger too long. It also has a nice caramel malt character to stand up to the piney, resinous hops and bitterness. So it's actually fairly balanced for such an aggressively hopped beer. Quite impressive and enjoyable.

Feel: It has a medium to medium plus mouthfeel with a bit of chewiness. Very clean.

Overall: It's really good. I kind of liken this beer to a stronger version of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale. For such a bitter and resinous beer, it's actually quite drinkable and refreshing! This is just my second Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon beer. Good stuff.

Beer was served golden orange with a nice white head.

Nose was a nice combination of tropical and citrus fruits.

Taste was new school IPA with a not quite imperial sized malt base that displays nice flavorful hops that give notes of orange, grapefruit, mango, and some strawberry finishing with a nice piney bitterness; 6/10 on my scale.

L - Light gold color with very slight haze and constant, mesmerizing streams of tiny bubbles that constantly rise through the beer. Huge, pillowy, frothy, off-white head that lasts and lasts.

S - Big hops aromas of grapefruit and mandarin orange, but with another earthy note, similar to pineapple. There is a bit of bready malt in the finish, very restrained, like a saltine cracker.

T - Strong, citrusy hops hit the mouth immediately, with navel orange, grapefruit and pine. The hop flavors are aggressive as hell and leave no room for malt to shine through. Exceptionally clean fermentation, with no yeast fruitiness noted.

F - Medium body with a bit of mouth-coating effect, yet somehow the finish feels dry. Moderate to high carbonation gives a fizzy impression on the tongue. Hops bitterness strong enough to peel paint. Alcohol presence fairly high, which matches the listed ABV, but the strength seems appropriate with all the other heightened sensory inputs.

O - This is a world-class American IPA, on the aggressive end of the style's spectrum. It slams your senses unapologetically, and I love it for that."

3348,Tripel Karmeliet,4.33,"L: Golden body, very even and thick two finger head. 
S: Fruity esters, pear and apple, floral perfume notes, a bit of funk, soft and sweet. 
T: The classic fruity Belgian character upfront. Fruit esters, tart pear, medicinal flavors, wheat malt, white pepper, a bit more bitterness in the body than I expected. Rich and full tasting, but simple. 
F: Moderate carbonation, noticeable warmth. 
O: This tastes old, and not in an old bottle way, in an old recipe way. I don’t know how else to describe it. The esters and malt are so nicely balanced, and not overwhelming. It’s gentle for the style, and all the better for it."
3349,Tripel Karmeliet,4.52,"I don't know what I've been doing but it's definitely fucking around because this is genuinely my first time having this one, and yet again in Brussels it of course comes in proper glassware!

The head is active as hell, so there you can already see how perfectly designed the glass is because it contains it top to bottom, while the body is a sparklingly clear wedding band gold.

Taste is more floral than I expect out of a tripel, which is unique to me, while still featuring some gently peppery phenols as well as some citrus peel and a touch of minerality. It's actually more beautifully bright of fruity characteristics like stonefruit, but also honeysuckle. It's incredible.

Tripel Karmeliet is one of most wonderfully expressive tripels I've ever had, and I regret not having had one of these ages ago. This could have changed my perspective of Belgian ales so drastically, and so much sooner. Hands down this is the best tripel on Earth."

Beautiful color and excellent head retention make this a beauty on your table or desk or wherever you're enjoying it. The smell of hazelnut and chocolate hit you every sip.

3362,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.28,"An overall lovely ale, with a slightly stronger taste of malt than I would prefer, and slightly less sweet than I feel it should be for that perfect balance. Really glad to have tried it, and would like to have it on draft someday."

3365,Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.53,"12 oz. can, canned 03/08/22.

Poured to a Duvel snifter.
Pours a dark ruby body, some bubbles show when held to the light. Thick finger of frothy khaki-tan head that leaves good spotty lacing.
Aroma is pleasantly toasty & nutty. Definitely invokes an authentic sense of earth / nuts / peanut / hazelnut. Slightly minerally / metallic.
Flavor profile has some muddled notes to it: earthy, herbal, bitter, with notes of dark fruits (cherries, figs, dates). Almost retains a tart cherry juice sort of quality, not sure if this is due to the age of the beer or what. Hazelnut is not exactly the main player here, if you ask me. Does retain some earthy nuttiness (peanut, hazelnut), but tastes more earthy & herbal & hoppy than anything else. Not as roasty as expected.
Feel is smooth, crisp, fairly easy-drinking. Carbonation is good.

Overall, a middle of the road offering from Rogue, in my opinion. Surprised to see that this beer has such high ratings here on the site.

Aroma and taste lived up to the hazelnut hype, and even the nectar part, as the feel was a bit thick and went down with a great deal of satisfaction. 

This one had a nice complexity between hops, malt and hazelnut. I will absolutely buy it again. It was also nice to have an English brown ale, as this style is not very common in South tx"

Golden yellow beer color. Nothing unique, but it’s pretty. Kinda like a newscaster is pretty in a generic way. 

Smells floral, lemony, and round. Full. Not quite lemon Pledge but full. Even for my poor smelling. 

Taste: too spicy-hoppy to be refreshing. The can lied to me. Tastes like it’s trying hard to be a proper snobby craft beer instead of a drinkable lager. Or like Sierra Nevada just couldn’t help themselves and made another IPA. 

Feel: a little thick and syrupy. Decent carbonation, but the overly heavy feel kinda goes with the hifalutin beer thing. 

Overall: not for me."

Look - Pours a thin and fizzy off-white head that dies down pretty quickly. Crystal clear, golden yellow appearance with tons of streaming bubbles.
Smell - The scent is mostly floral hops and lager yeast. Also picking up some woodiness and slight zesty lemon qualities.
Taste - The taste follows the nose with the floral hops and woodiness dominating the most. The slight bitterness seems to be cancelled by a lemon sweetness in the aftertaste.

Overall - So intrigued by all the pics posted and solid reviews of this lager that I had to pick one up and see for myself what all the hype was about. Pour was an old school pale straw and the scent brought back memories of the lagers I grew up on. Bready malts, floral and a hint of menthol on the nose.

Brewers Notes: A demonic Russian-Style Imperial Stout brewed with coffee, Mexican vanilla, and Indian sugar, this beer defies description. Available one day a year, in April at the brewery: Dark Lord Day.

Vintage guide: Black wax wrapped label = 2020

Bottle received in bif17 courtesy of @ovaltine

Room temperature bottle poured into a pretentious beer glass. Dark cola brown liquid, little foam , settles to a ring 

Aroma is coffee,molasses, brown sugar, tobacco

Taste is coffee, dark fruits, raisins, tobacco, char , port wine

Sudsy mouthfeel, lighter than I expected , boozy 

Good beer, reminds me more of a barley wine than a RIS"
3401,Dark Lord,4.27,"2009 vintage. Poured from a bomber into a snifter. 

Impenetrable seal brown/bistre liquid with a faint almond event horizon. Vague collar, never quite awakens. Thick sheets of legs.

Molasses, port, cherries, cocoa, and char in the nose. More fruit as the ale warms.

Prunes, cherries, and port are forward on the palate. Vinous quality persists with a background of dark malt, black licorice, and faint chocolate. Blackberries, violets, dulce de leche, ash, clay, and figs. Some oxidation is leading this into Old Ale territory, but no cardboard or other off notes. Low bitterness, medium-sweet, linear finish. 

Oily, slick, carbonation has faded though there is some life left.

After 14 years, this has evolved into something difficult to categorize, and in some ways closer to a fortified dessert wine than a RIS."

Taste: Sweet, dark fruit, charred notes, plum, prunes, fig, cherries, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, coffee, burnt sugar.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied with soft carbonation.

Sweet vanilla hits the tongue first. It’s followed by coffee, much milder dates/figs/raisins. The sweetness stays for the duration, but isn’t over the top or unwanted. Again, in the background there is a charred food/ashy quality that I like. Not boozy in the least.

3426,Focal Banger,4.55,"Enjoying on the front porch, gorgeous, cool August day, the 18th, 2023. (Canned on 8/15/23!)

So excited to find this treasure at our Washington beer store.

Gorgeous straw/light golden color, slightly hazy, with white foam of tiny bubbles, dissipated quickly leaving fine lace on glass edge.

Very fruity aromas of pineapple, papaya, mango, luscious lemon and even malt!

Immediate bitter hits the tongue which gives way to the fruit flavors and ends sharp grapefruit rind.

This hits all the right notes for an excellent NEIPA for me! Leah prefers the sweeter Heady Topper, whereas I'll stick to this one as my favorite!

Edit.... We had bought two cans, and we drank the second one fiber nights after the first one. I had worked hard on a pool electrical job in the sun that day, and WOW!... What an intense beer to drink after a hot day on the sun. By the time we were on the porch, it had cooled off considerably, and it was raining..... Drinking this Focal Banger was pure joy! Pine, hop, depth, in your face hoppy bitterness..... Pure joy!"

T - Follows the nose: fresh, bright, piney, resinous, bitter hops up front and throughout, intermixed well with grapefruit and other citrus notes with a nice malt backbone. Slightly dank
F - medium, leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth.
O - another world class IPA from alchemist - a softer version of Heady"

Beer poured a hazy golden with a nice white head that has sustained hang time.

Nose is very nice, fresh citrus abounds from the glass long after pouring.

Taste is spot on. The light pale malt base displays the grapefruit forward hops and it tastes like the pink grapefruit fresh off my tree at my old PHX house in the spring. Finishes with a superb rind and pine bitterness; 7/10 on my scale.

Mouthfeel is light bodied with each sip very refreshing.

Overall, yep, the hype is correct on this one. This is a world class ipa!"
3429,Focal Banger,4.34,"Canned on 7/18/23 - Just 15 days ago!

Drank most from can as directed, but did pour 4 oz amount in rocks glass for appearance 

Appearance – The beer pours a lightly hazed lime-yellow color with a small head of white foam. The head has a good level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell – The aroma is strong of a grapefruit and herbal hop smell mixed with notes of cracker malt and a touch of bread and toast. Other hop aromas of pine and earth, are there as well, with all the aromas having a fresh “raw” like smell. Hints of caramel and a sizeable grass like smell are there as well, giving a rather green smell overall.

Taste – The taste begins with a crisp cracker malt body paired with a lot of the “raw” hop that was present in the nose. An herbal hop is the biggest, but is accompanied by a decent showing of grapefruit as well. Other light earthy flavors mix in as time goes on all while a little bit of caramel and orange that were present upfront fade. The grass that was in the nose also joins the scene, all with a bit of an increase in the hop. Toward the end, the fresh hop taste steps it up even more, giving a quite heave hop pellet like taste to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a moderate carbonation. For the mix of big fresh hop with crisp body, the middle of the road mouthfeel balances the two attributes rather well.

Overall – A rather fresh, raw hop pellet tasting IPA. I like it, but in some ways a bit unbalanced with bitterness at the end. Certainly, a great brew, although I am not sure it deserves as much hype as it gets."

I have to say it tastes nothing like the cans or bottles sold in the US. This beer has no equal in taste, mouth feel, and character. It made me change the way I see lagers. This beer is rich, with nuanced flavor that changes from the sweet moment the solid white foam touches your lips, through the hop bitterness that hits you at the back of your tongue, to the floral accents felt in your nose when exhaling. It felt like a snack when just drinking it at a bar, and like another dish when having it with a meal. I also had German lagers on the same trip, and while these are fantastic, Pilsner Urquell is in my opinion the Queen of all beer."

3462,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.13,"From a 500ml bottle, dated 03/11/23. Served in a spiegelau tulip glass.

Pours a thin-appearing oak-brown with no obvious highlights. A generous finger of lush, coffee colored foam doesn’t last but maybe 20 seconds leaving a narrow collar and a rousable spatter of oily, super-slippery lacing.

Nose is… fruity? A sweet, candy-like coffee aroma and, totally unexpectedly, raspberry - which must be an olfactory hallucination, or at least how my brain is interpreting the combination of vanilla, cinnamon and chiles.

Taste is sweet but not heavily so, with a berry-like coffee bean flavour and that fruity mélange of cinnamon-vanilla-chile pepper that my brain persists in translating as ‘raspberry’ bringing a brightness and lightness which keeps the beer from tasting syrupy. A slick Cadbury-like milk chocolatey character becomes more evident as the beer warms accompanied by some heat from the chiles. There’s a very faint soy sauce quality in the aftertaste which doesn’t detract much.

Feel is oily-smooth and creamy-slick, medium bodied but a little light relative to the style with gentle, prickly carbonation. Chile heat builds up on the palate somewhat and amplifies the otherwise mild carbonation, lightening the mouthfeel further.

Overall, pretty good but maybe a little bit of a mixed bag. I won’t call the flavours ‘muddled,’ but it is a very ‘busy’ flavour profile which, weirdly, for my palate, comes across very fruity and raspberry-like."
3463,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,3.88,"2022 pint can, chilled, left to warm. Flat black on the pour, thick, sticky, tiny bit of struggled foam that vanished fast.
Smells like cinnamon, vanilla, cacao nibs, and chilli peppers being muddled together.
Tastes the same. Just too much going on. Cloyingly sweet and thick, slightly gritty, too much cinnamon, and who needs hot peppers in their stout?
Overall, I’ve attended 5 Hunahpu’s Day celebrations at the CCB Spruce Street brewery over the years and have bought a bottle or can each time and come away thinking the same thing: nice novelty.,. but way too busy and quite over rated."
3464,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.33,"2020 vintage received courtesy of @roguer. 

Appearance is typical for the style, which means it's a nice looking dark, dark brown with a half inch of tan colored head. Nice legs. Aroma is wonderfully rich and decadent, but not in an artificial way. Plenty of sweet molasses, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and some faint figs / raisins. That description doesn't do this any real justice, so in summary, this beer smells great. 

Taste is interesting. Nowhere near as sweet on the nose, with some naturally bitter cacao notes, cinnamon and pepper combining brilliantly with the base beer. The spiciness is Goldilocks.....just right. A bit less and they wouldn't be notable. A bit more and they would overpower. There's a really nice sweetness deep into the finish that helps add to the complexity of this beer. Fully bodies and smooth, leaving a really nice coating on the tongue with a pleasant alcohol warming. 

Overall this is excellent."

We’re nearing the end of the BIF beers I got from @Eziel back in February, and this one is a heavy hitter. This has been a big want for me for a while, so it’s awesome to finally be able to try it. Let’s see what this famoud spicy Stout is really all about

Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This is highly complex in the nose, not too peppery and balanced in its sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nibs, vanilla bean, chili pepper, spicy whiskey, burnt coffee, sweet toffee, brown sugar, and light charred oak

This is a bit restrained in taste, perhaps due to the age but I still really enjoy it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark chocolate, roasty coffee, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, cinnamon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, caramel, toasted oak, earthy whiskey, and burnt coffee

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and earthy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a lingering heat

While I enjoyed this, I’d hardly put it on legendary status. Again, maybe it’s the age so I’d love to try it fresh, but even still"

Pours very dark with no light shining through, next to no cap or lacing.

Dark chocolate and fudge brownies on the sniff.

Super smooth, nice complexity exhibited by the notes of more chocolate/brownies/cinnamon/dark malts.

Delicious creation, no doubt aided by a few years in the bottle....get some of this fine nectar, if ya have the opportunity."

3480,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.33,"This is a tame IPA, but I like it well enough. I'd be happy to drink it a party at which I didn't pay for it. :) Haha! That's not a bash, it's just a very inoffensive and NOT rebellious form of the style that has a more pronounced malt profile and a balanced and tame hope bite.

Sure, if you are not an IPA drinker you may notice what might be perceived as a strong hop presence, giving it the typical citrus and pine notes. It does pour a golden color with a frothy head, creating an inviting appearance so there's also that...put it in a glass and church it up baby!! 

The standout features of this beer is its balance. Despite the high hop content, it manages to maintain a smooth and drinkable flavor that I think makes it very middling in the true sense of the word, but not necessarily in a bad way. 

The bitterness is well-matched with a malty sweetness, creating a harmonious flavor profile. This beer is perfect for those who enjoy a strong and hoppy IPA without overpowering the senses

A brewery that made it's name NOT making hoppy beers has made one that I think is aligned with their overall portfolio. I can appreciate this as their IPA, not THE prototypical American or WC IPA, this is a Sam Adams IPA and it's good!"

3492,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.63,"Poured a couple of brown 12 oz. bottles into a singular clear glass liter mug for observation. It's a light bright copper color, with emphasis on light. Rather translucent more than colorful, maybe the head and lacing will compensate. No, there's little of either there. The lacing outperforms, but not by much. It's not aromatic, neither. OK, now for the taste, the big category. Unfortunately, nothing to rave about here. It's pretty good; well balanced between a noticeable malt backbone, which is more earthy than sweet (good) and a hoppy finish. The body is a little thin and the hops aren't bitter enough, but they're there. If ever there was an IPA intended to be mass produced to offend the least number of drinkers, this is it. Not at all rebellious, it conforms to the basic norms of a mainstream beer with a hint of a style above the standard American lager. Likely the best choice at national chain restaurants."
3493,Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.87,"12/11/14:
Appearance: clear, bright golden hue, long-lasting, bone white head, looking good.

Aroma: Fresh and lively hop aromatics, screaming with citrus and tropical fruits, bristling with pine and grass. Green as it gets.

Taste: Brisk hop bite at the front, soft and mellow from there on out. Light bodied, but with a long, bitter hop finish. Exquisite drinkability, but for hop-heads only. Bitter hop resins lay long on the palate, providing more than sufficient refreshment for those of us who crave the alpha acids.

A very nice rendition of this popular style, but it's not just not landing on the top tier, I'm afraid. A few steps short.

Wait. I just noticed something. The box reads: ""Enjoy before Dec. 2014."" No specific date given. This was purchased in early December 2014. I always see a lot of these cases at the store I bought it at, I'm guessing it's not that popular, for whatever reason. Maybe if I'd bought it earlier, it would taste fresher, and I'd see higher up on that tier…maybe...

3530,Hop Nosh IPA,4.03,"Based on my fairly unkind perception of Hop Nosh's expression back in 2015, I find it absolutely necessary to delete my old review and reevaluate now, as that opinion just does not apply anymore, largely in terms of my own palate, preferences and overall experiential evolution.

Lightly foggy orange-amber--just about as hazy as Hazy Nosh, ironically enough--with a moderately short off-white head leaving substantial but fluid lacing that falls back down to the surface in slo-mo.

A solid West Coast IPA with plenty of citrus and pine working in concert, it's quite a bit more bitter and dank than their hazy, obviously, but without all that limey juiciness, instead exhibiting some catty hints in the exhale. However, it's quite clean up front, and stunningly reminds me of the sort of prickly resins often found in Fat Head's stellar IPA program, although paired with a lesser hint of dampening graham.

The moderate body has a gently expanding carbonation and finishes just dry."

the beer pours a murky light copper color with a ton of floaties. Kind of surprised after reading so many reviews describing the color as a clear copper color... about three fingers worth of rocky white head with substantial lacing.

Lots of citrus fruits in the aroma, as well as some pineapple, mango, and papaya. Mildly bready and earthy malts balance out the hopiness. 

Like the aroma the flavor is orange, papaya, mango, with a nice bready, toasty malt character. Great balance. Medium bodied and slick on the tounge. A bit heavier than most IPA's, definitely a well balanced beer more in line with the east coast IPA style, but with the big citrusy hop punch of a west coast IPA

Aside from Stella, this must be the 2nd most mass produced beer from Belgium I think. I used to drink it lots in Australia...as Australian beers are usually pretty terrible.

Good creamy froth that stays in the glass. Some quite large bubbles. Aroma is banana and cloves. 

Flavour has elements of soy sauce, haha I always thought this. There is a herbiness coming through, and elements of orange peel, cloves, lemon peel, and more soy sauce. It's not as complex as the best Belgian beers, but considering this is mass produced by Inbev, it's still pretty good. But it lacks the mouth feel and complexity of an unpasteurized trappist ale. According to the bottle it contains added vanilla also. Now that I have read this, I can taste a little vanilla ; ) But banana is more noticeable, there is a little vanilla in the aftertaste.

The taste isn't particularly smooth...it's kind of angry and chaotic...and it tastes like it contains more alcohol than it actually does. A Westervelen 12 or Rochefort 10 both taste like they contain less alcohol than this.

Very good, but not quite great. Happy to drink this again, though from memory, sometimes the bottles actually go bad before you drink them, so be careful. Or maybe this was just my dad's cellar. The flavour is a bit too soy saucy for me, though still one of the best mass produced beers out there for sure.

This is headed for 4.5% and in the gutter with pissy Heineken etc! I kind of knew it was going bad the moment they switched from corks to metal caps on the 750ml btls, a few years later they've proved me right!

This was a long time want for me before I knew the whole story of it, and ultimately ended up forgetting about it. However, when I saw it on Tavour I figured it was at least worth a shot. Let's crack it open and see if it's really as bad as some say

Pours a hazy pale yellow with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose is quite vibrant here, I'm not really understanding the complaints yet. I'm picking up on aromas of red grapefruit, gooseberry, grassy hops, rye bread, white pepper, orange zest, light papaya, and white grape

It's a bit less balanced in taste for sure, focusing more on the bitterness, but it's still damn good. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting gooseberry, earthy hops, lemon zest, rye bread, grass, overripe cantaloupe, and light weed. The swallow brings notes of rye bread, earthy hops, black pepper, lemon zest, papaya, pithy grapefruit, light papaya, and dank weed

A light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a snappy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness to keep things refreshing

Maybe drinking this through the lens of not having had the original invalidates my opinion, but I don't really care. This isn't perfect, but a damn good IPA as is"
3623,Nelson,4.18,
3624,Nelson,3.79,"I first rated Alpine's Nelson in 2015, and gave it a 4.41 average rating. It's been the third highest of all the IPAs I've rated over the years, not quite 200.

In those early years (2014-2015), I had Nelson on tap a few times. It was uncommon in Seattle, but always a treat.

Well, now I've had Nelson in cans, and I guess it's the ""new Nelson"". I've read about some of the behind the scenes stuff on who's made it. I don't know the whole story, but I do know that the beer I just had in a six pack is nothing too special. It's nowhere near what I remember of the once ethereal beer. So I deleted my old rating, as it no longer applies. This is a new rating/review, as of July 2023.

Nelson looks gorgeous, big fluffy white head, and golden color. The smell is piney. It's a little out of the ordinary for a 2023 beer, as it's not a citrus bomb (grapefruit), like Pliny, and it's also a long way from the fruity hazy taste profiles of NE IPAs. It's kind of old school, which I like. However, the rye character has pretty much gone missing, and the Nelson Sauvin hop profile isn't nearly as good as I remembered. Fortunately, it's still got a solid bitterness to it.

I guess I'm just pining for the OG."

3627,Nelson,4.23,"Found this on Friday while returning from some hiking and stopped at Total Wine on the way back to the Old Line State. This is obviously a beer that needs no introduction and I wasn't sure if it was available on the east coast. Opaque, ultra yellow body like a latter day hazy IPA but the nose is more familiar citrus and grapefruit lending towards pine but still fruity. 

The flavor is unique; very dry at the outset, it seems pretty subtle but continues to develop and deliver throughout the aftertaste. High carbonation also hides flavor in the early stages before revealing grapeskin, bread, bubble gum, melon, and finally, the promised rye. Really nice, luxurious mouthfeel is a highlight as well. I did not love the start, but this one grew on me."
3628,Nelson,4.4,"2x12oz cans poured into a large dimpled stein while I smoke some salmon and relax on a cool Saturday evening
can says it’s best by today
L: hazy yellow-tangerine colored body; frothy eggshell head holds great retention
S: juicy citrus, pineapple, stone fruit, wheat perhaps, faint spicy rye
T: rye is more prominent in flavor adding some spiciness and robustness; juicy pineapple, tangerine, mango, and nectarine with bitter pine on the finish
F: fuller body, ample carbonation, bittersweet finish with pine and citrus zest lingering with the spicy rye; very dry finish
O: I love a rye IPA; I’ve never had one like this - world class beer here!"
3629,Nelson,4.3,"A classic that I understand has changed throughout the years. Sampled on tap. Hazy orange with notes of citrus, white grape, lemon, bubblegum, bread crust, and weed, on both the nose and taste. Low to medium bitterness with a medium mouthfeel and carb. A textbook, well-executed Nelson profile. White grape aftertaste. Very good. Each category is pushing 4.5 for me, so I give this a 4.5 overall."
3630,Nelson,3.75,"Pours a very hazy orange-yellow with a one finger head. Aroma is oranges and, to a small extent, lemons. Taste is clean and very orangey. This is a clean, no frills IPA and that is also its' strength -- it does one thing and one thing well."
3631,Nelson,4.75,Pours orange hue with a thick head. Smells of citrus orange peel. Taste of citrus hits immediately with orange and light pineapple. Medium bodied and smooth. One of the best IPAs I’ve had. Worth it!

3633,Nelson,4.06,
3634,Nelson,4.2,"My go-to IPA. Pours with a bright orange with a thick white head. Smells of orange peel. Taste of mixed citrus and sweet fruits (pineapple, orange) with a mild bitter finish. A little fizzy with a medium body."
3635,Nelson,4.34,"12oz can enjoy by date 02/06/23 into a nonic pint glass.
L: Pours hazed straw golden yellow w a thin white even head, low carbo, head down to a thick skin, light drink-patterned lacing.
S: Buttery caramel, sweet citrus, hard pineapple candy, a hint of plum, light melon, bubble gum or Juicy Fruit chewing gum, overall fruity.
T: Candied pineapple, caramelized malts, orange, tastes are mildly dense, bright citrus, white grape, a little pull of sourness & tangy bitter undefined fruit rind.
F: Gently fizzy then smooth & glassy w a medium body and a residually brisk and bright citrusy med-long finish that is slightly drying.
O: A very tasty and easy drinking American IPA with a very smooth feel. Well balanced tastes, lightly sweet with a subtle bitter linger. This beer is delightful and is world-class in its style."
3636,Nelson,4.29,"Pours a cloudy yet bright sun yellow with a thick long-lasting white head. Nice lacing. Aroma is tropical fruit. Flavor follows the nose, sweet oranges and melon in front with a mild hop bitterness in the finish. Feel is medium bodied and adequately carbonated. Overall, a very nice beer."
3637,Nelson,4.27,
3638,Nelson,4.39,"This is a genuinely good India Pale Ale, but it may not be for everyone. First of all, it's hazy, but it's not an NEIPA. Secondly, it's dry and bitter, which many of us love, but if you're looking for a well-balanced beer in terms of hops vs. malts, this is NOT for you! 

Nelson is bitter, and I think it's made with rye which accentuates hops, but it's also not hard to drink and is quite ""zesty"" in terms of hops, meaning it's less piney and more fruit forward (citrus, but with layers of character, and that's cool because this is a single hop IPA obviously as the name implies). I like this beer, a lot. It's usually expensive, it may not be canned by Alpine, blah, blah, blah...it's great and if you like IPAs, it's a must-try beer."
3639,Nelson,4.04,"Can with unreadable date. GL Tulip.

A: pours a turbid hazy yellow with three fingers of meringue-like frothy white head. No visible carbonation; it’s too hazy.

S: from a foot away I can smell the sweet, tropical fruitiness. Like papaya and gooseberries in syrup.

T: on first arrival, hop burn; tangy, tart, tropical, citric, floral, ending on a grapefruit rind light bitterness. There is a lingering bitterness that I actually find unpleasant. I think it’s the rye. I love rye whiskey, but I can’t think of a single rye beer I’ve liked - including this one. The hop burn and sweetness on the arrival make it unpleasant, as does the weird rye finish.

M: lighter side of medium, pillow-soft. 

O: I saw this on the shelf ten years ago, and wanted to buy it but passed it up. I didn’t start seeing it here again until a year ago, and that’s post AB acquisition. I wasn’t willing to get a six, but I saw a single today and wasn’t going to miss it again. When this beer came out, ten years ago, it was revolutionary. Not so much today. Its beautiful to look at and smell, and is still a great example of the hazy IPA style, but strikes me as too fruity and unpleasant on the finish. At least it’s got a good name."
3640,IPA,3.77,
3641,IPA,3.46,"Fourteen years ago, when I moved from California to Massachusetts, it was the first local beer I fell in love with. It was always a lot better on draft than from the bottle, and I still will order it at Logan airport or in Boston restaurants if nothing that holds great appeal to me is available. It’s a little too bland for my taste now. Still, a good solid IPA."
3642,IPA,4.0,"Just looking through all the ratings and reviews this beer has garnered during its long run and cannot find anything new to add except to reemphasize many of its fine qualities. From its handsome appearance to the tasty, balanced finish, it is a solid well made ""4"" that has not abandoned its roots."
3643,IPA,4.32,"Appearance: Clear amber, fluffy white head with good retention.

Aroma: Citrus and toasted, bready malt.

Flavor: Citrus, toast and bread. Moderately sweet. Moderate bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Drying, moderate carbonation, medium length finish.

Overall: Another iconic, old school IPA. Pours a clear amber color producing a nice fluffy white head with good retention. The Cascade and Cluster Hops provide citrus aromas of grapefruit and oranges that distinguish the nose. You also get some toasty bread hints from the lightly roasted malts. Tastes include citrus notes combined with the sweet malt that you would expect from a beer of amber color. Bitterness is quite restrained; however, the sweetness is as well, giving it a nice balance between the two. It finishes on the dry side with a medium aftertaste. Well crafted, classically balanced IPA."

Mouthfeel is moderate with light carbonation."

taste is sweet and juicy, with a floral flair up front that fades to an earthy light bitterness tinged with pine with the finish

mouthfeel in fairly thin bodied with high carbonation, running slightly watery and grainy with a pillowed, juicy edge before finishing mildly dry and leaving a slightly sweet herbal aftertaste tinged with earthy bitterness

overall:
solid session IPA that runs mostly sweet and juicy but manages a solid balance thanks to a cascade hop bittersweetness. 
wouldn't consider it one of the greats, but it's in the top 15 for me as far as highbrow craft IPA flagships."
3659,IPA,3.22,"Not one of the better ones I have had from Harpoon, but still solid enough to enjoy.

Just not necessarily memorable."

3673,Gulden Draak,4.16,"365ml bottle

Carbonation has the bottle overflowing once I crack the lid. Pours two fingers of dense tan head into my snifter. Retention is very nice, but does eventually fade. Lacing is subpar. Body is a deep reddish brown. Looks decent.

Nose has plenty of sweetness, with notes of fig and plum. Tart esters quickly appear and add a much needed balance, reminiscent of cherries. No clove. Smells massive, as you’d expect. A little on the sweet side for me, but I can dig it.

Flavor blasts you with a massive dose of stone fruit, has a sweet impression, but drinks very clean. Maybe a touch of tart cherries in the background. Overall it’s still not my go-to style, but it’s impressive, and certainly something I would not turn down.

The carbonation is medium by the time I go looking for it, don’t recall it being insanely high to begin with. Sweetness is apparent, but pretty modest compared to what it could be; well attenuated. Bitterness is low and only really shows up briefly in the finish with the tart fruit. Has some body, but comes through surprisingly light, given the modest sugar and carbonation. Overall the mouthfeel stays reasonable, and it brings a somewhat smooth feel that supports the beer nicely.

All things considered, the drinkability is very very nice. There is zero alcohol and the sweetness is in check.

Between the flavor and the mouthfeel, the beer drinks even better than it smells. Very nice."

A two finger khaki head seals the slightly hazy chestnut pour into the tulip. The persistent foam is tight and creamy except for an island of spongy foam rising slightly in the middle of the glass.

The nose is full and malty. An opening mineral aroma fades revealing dark fruit (raisin), milk chocolate and toffee-like dark sugars and a hoppy note in the back. The taste is less sweet than expected, malty, pruny and sweet candied plum flavors with some mineral notes seem to be cut short by a semi-dry and fairly clean finish. Hop bitterness is very mild. Mouthfeel is medium weight with moderate carbonation and soft right through.

On arrival there is a very light haze in a deep gold body dome lacing forms.

Aroma is more of an old school WCIPA, with a touch of dank edd, and an almost toasty malt in the very back. Not as intense as expected. Slight bitter herbal hops that are almost but not quite piney.

Taste follows the aroma with a decent bitterness right up front, that carries an herbal, dank, flavor that fades slightly to a mellow pine resin, and toasted malt. Super clean and crisp. 

The feel is super smooth, due to a dryness taming the full malty body. Finish is longer and is very balanced with a slight warming sensation. Very good 7%+ IPA in this category.

In any event, this particular brew is black in color. It boasts a thick, lasting, tan head. The nose is muted initially; it is faintly redolent of sweetness, cream, and spice.

It is creamy and medium-bodied in feel.

3751,Miller High Life,1.61,"This is a beautiful looking beer. It is well carbonated and keeps a frothy white head. These are its best qualities, and beyond then, it is truly an awful beer. It has no malt character and almost no bitterness (I would guess about 6 or 7 IBU's). The aftertaste is carbonated water. On the bright side, this is the beer that is going to help me cut down on drinking."

3755,Miller High Life,4.0,"Back in my early 20’s whenever I would drink at home instead of going out to a house party or a dive bar, Miller High Life and Budweiser were my go to beers. The taste has a rich creaminess to it, at least that is what I get out of it. I also love the design of the bottles, it is a mixture of classy and cheesy that really appeals to me, however I do prefer the taste out of the can more. One of the most satisfying bottom shelf beers you’ll find, it’s Miller High Life “The Champagne of Beers!

3783,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.25,"Poured into a tulip. 

Pours clear dark brown with garnet highlights. Excellent tan foamy head. Limited head. Excellent lacing. 

Detectable to strong acidity on the nose with dark fruit and caramel sugar notes. Perhaps some orange peel.

The flavor is complex and refined. Acidic but not overpoweringly so. Excellent balance with sweeter flavors of apple, raisin, and a bit of oaking. The mature beer portion of this blend is what keeps the restraint just right.

Like the flavor, the feel is well balanced. Not drying but not sticky either. Vanishing carbonation. The first few sips have a fair amount; it subsides into tart smoothness quickly.

For my personal taste, this brew may be a shade sweet and tame for the style, but that's also the level of restraint the brewer was intentionally pursuing. Nailed it to say the least."

3785,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.79,"poured from the bottle into Belgian tulips. It's too cold for critical tasting but I didn't want wait. My wife loves sours so I've tried many over the years.
L: muddy river water, hazy brown, not the look I'd be shooting for, but we don't drink beer with our eyes
S: beautiful. you can smell the acid forthwith, accompanied by caramel or toffee, a box of raisins, maybe some orange peel
T: racy acidity. Sour orange, raisins and toffee. Long sour finish. Elegant stuff compared to the kettle sours you find sometimes at brewpubs. Not as serious and complex as our best wild ales. Somewhere in between.
F: appropriate weight. Any more malt and it would be a mess. Definitely not too thin.
O: a fun treat - glad someone came up with this style of beer back in the dark ages. They built some beautiful gothic cathedrals too, so maybe not too dark. The acidity of this one is high and more to my wife's tastes - I think I prefer the Duchesse one, but this is still super fantastic"

3789,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.11,"330ml bottle into a goblet. My best guess at age is bottled September 2020.

3790,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.16,
3791,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.71,
3792,Rodenbach Grand Cru,2.42,"Appearance: Poured with a sliver of head that simply couldn't stick around and produced no lace. The body is a opaque cloudy brown, which barely reveals a hint of red when put up to the light, which I suppose is appropriate to style, but doesn't seem very appetizing to me for some reason.

Smell: Oh dear...it's like some kind on unholy mix of wine, apple cider and malt vinegar. I think I am also catching a bit of caramel malt in the background. I will given points certainly of potency, as zero warmup needed for that to be produced. I'll also give it points for complexity, but this is an assault on my olfactory senses. This is a sour at a level that I just can't see liking. 

Taste: Where this beer starts, is where I'd have liked it to end. There is a potent lemon note seemingly barely curbed by some nice notes of cherry and apple, but then the beast is let loose as it passed outright into drinking vinegar with some brown sugar thrown into it, before this odd dry sand skunkness kind of creeps in over the ruins of that experience. There is identifiable complexity here, but the core sour component overshadows it. It's like an Indy band you like, touring with a band that plays with metal nails and a chalkboard.

Mouthfeel: The transitioning here starts high and jumps into orbit, and is then lost to the solar winds, leaving behind acid and sand for us to contemplate. That passes to go back to just a sour lemon note in the aftertaste, which would could be present, if you didn't experience what caused it. Carbonation is also pretty much absent here. There's very little here I enjoy.

Drinkability: Drinkable like a fancy lemonade, made with every bell and whistle, except you used half the water, and no sugar. Way too potent for my liking, and the acidic note I mentioned earlier seems to linger at the top of my stomach after it has gone down. At least the low carbonation doesn't further agitate things down there.

Final Thoughts: I don't think I've ever had a Flanders Red Ale I truly liked, but I also don't recall one ever being this potent. I know there are people who enjoy this, and that this is their jam. There are notes there that tell me, yes this beer is a remarkably complex offering. However for me, they are buried under the sour note of this offering. This is very much not for me, and didn't even make it pass the half way mark. If you relish in sours, this might be for you but this is a hard pass for me."
3793,Rodenbach Grand Cru,3.74,I do not like sours but this is one that got it right. Would not consider it sour but “tangy” in a way. Initially I felt the smell was of a “nail polish” fragrance but learning that it’s made with “Red Wine Vineger” Explains that. Definitely would order another if I’m in the mood for a tangy beer.
3794,Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.54,"When it hit my lips my first words were ""Oh Wow"" ..... Appearances can be deceiving because it's not much to look at.... But a fragrant nose and a great feel along with terrific smooth taste and flavor gives us a big time thumbs up for me"

Feel is OILY and gelatinous. Finishes very crisp though. Intriguing beer.

Overall - I've definitely had this before but I always seems to ignore great divide for whatever reason. I think im primarily annoyed by their yeti series and how they absolutely try to milk the fuck out off it, but thats another topic. Regardless, its been a LONG time since I've bought a GD beer (probably close to ten years) but this beer is a super nice reminder of where beer was at 10-15 years ago.

Seeing as how I have the lowest review on here I looked at others and they're all as flabbergasted as I am. I really hope we all got bad bottles or cans and it will be better next time.

I’m upping it a point. Original rating: Bottle, at The Rover, Göteborg. Amber colour, hazy. Sweet and alcoholic aroma and flavour, but also plenty of hops, as expected from a ""double IPA"".

L: Dark amber with a moderate amount of foam. A slight amount of bubbles. 3.75

S: Hard to put a finger on what this smells like. Smells like it will taste sour. It has notes of a typical IPA, but different. 3.0

T: Tastes about like it smells... kind of weird. It has a harshness that sort of overpowers the other flavors of the beverage. This is a higher ABV than I am accustomed to, which might account for the issues. Bitterness from hops is about the only other thing I can discern. I get no sweetness, at all, even as the brew warmed. 2.75

Smell- Toasted oats, cacao, toffee, medium strength of scent.

Taste- Coffee, cacao, cherry, mildly sweet, high strength of flavor.

Feel- Between medium and full body, average carbonation, moderately bitter, mildly sweet, moderately mouth coating, moderately mouth warming.

Overall- Black with medium brown frothy head and above average head retention and lacing. Bouquet was medium in strength and dominated by toasted oats with notes of cacao and toffee. Taste was high in strength and a superbly balanced mix of coffee, cacao and cherry. Feel was between medium and full body with moderate mouth warming and moderate coating properties.

Impenetrable seal brown liquid with a lasting dun collar. Fine lacing; thick viscous legs. Surprisingly good retention. 

Molasses, chocolate covered cherries, medium-roast coffee, maple candy, and complex malt in the nose. 

Stale coffee, milk chocolate, weak tobacco, and brown sugar on the palate. Low bitterness, faint grapefruit, but the hops have faded. Flavors are good but a bit flat, though there are few other signs of oxidation. Medium finish with malt balls, loam, and plum pudding.

Medium-full bodied, creamy, with decent carbonation. ABV is well integrated. 

After 15 years this is surely past its prime, but remains a brooding, stately gentleman of an ale."
3869,Darkness,4.06,"2016 Vintage served at 52 degrees. 

While the color of this beer is like pretty much every other stout, what stands out is the glorious, thick and persistent dark tan colored head. Beautiful looking consistency and excellent lacing. Rare for me to think of a stout as anything above a 3.75, but this is getting a 4.5 

Nose isn't up to the same level as the look, but it's still really nice, highlighted by loads of chocolate, toffee and faint roast. Taste largely follows, but with much more roast & coffee. Body is not quite as hefty as I anticipated. I want to say it's light, but it also feels like a milkshake, and those two things don't seem to make sense together, so I'm not sure how to describe it. Regardless, this is quite tasty. Glad I finally cracked it open."

3871,Darkness,4.54,"(bomber, black-waxed, Darkness 2020; purchased off shelf at Shangy's last week... poured into my Trillium fat tulip)

L: tight, creamy dark tan foam; dark brown liquid, bordering on black, opaque... head recedes into a splotchy cap and smeared collar, but it laces lots in jagged, fingery-flecked bands

S: mint and espresso overtones; bittersweet dark chocolate... slowly emerging hints of roasted grains, alcohol, Irish Cream qualities... a few beats later, charred and deeply toasted, caramelized grain... kind of an overall typical RIS aroma profile; tonic, outdoorsy top notes; perhaps short of cinematic in scope, but nonetheless invigorating

T: big burst of bold flavors: espresso, toffee, molasses cookie... sweetish, roasty, residual underbelly and lightly campfiery, roasted nutty overtones in the aftertaste; big burp after a minute brings up sweetish, sooty dark chocolate... second big sip, more of a rounded malt character, with the interplay, contrast, and divide of heavy roast and rich crystal malts more stark; still little booziness, but some delicate spicy phenols and dark dried fruit notes starting to surface, and not long after some subtle black licorice... hop herbality finally opens up, rising above the burnt bliss of sugars below

F: cooling quality to its aromatics... slick velvet texture... lithe levity despite its luscious lines... medium-full bodied, bordering on the latter... malt milk, attenuated and accentuated by the balance of booze; dark nog, rib-sticking... maybe it's the 2 years on this, but it's heaven to my senses

O: not the most nuanced, but a pretty darn solid RIS... its sweetness is a touch more redolent than most style examples but luckily the roasted barley and hop bitterness are as intense, lending some needed balance... as expected, its high marks are likely because of its relative unavailability; this was the first time (along with Abrasive) that I've encountered it out this way, so I was easily compelled to buy a bottle (2086)"

3874,Darkness,4.34,"2021 vintage

I’ve been sitting on this one for a minute now and I’m excited to finally try it. An absolute classic RIS, and one that totally caught me off guard when I saw it at the store, just sitting on the shelf. This is also my first beer from Surly so I’m even more hyped. Let’s tackle this massive beast

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

There’s still a solid bitterness to this for being 2 years old which is quite surprising to me. I’m picking up on aromas of leafy hops, burnt caramel, molasses, dark chocolate, charred wood, dark roast coffee, light vanilla, and red grape

While still bitter in taste, it feels like it’s integrated much better than the nose. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting red grape, cocoa powder, charred malt, caramel, vanilla bean, black cherry, sweetened coffee, light earthy hops, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of res grape, black cherry, molasses, milk chocolate, light roast coffee, leafy hops, vanilla bean, sweet caramel, and charred malt

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and lightly boozy beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time

Oh yeah, this is really good. Warm and complex, it develops over the course of the drink. I’ll have to try other vintages"

While high in abv and pitch black, it is super creamy and loaded with underlying tones of dark dried fruit like prunes, figs, or dates, and subtle hints of cocoa and coffee. I am not suggesting they are added, but they are present in the flavor profile. This stout is truly remarkable and I am so happy it is available locally (PA) for the first time in forever."

Poured pitch black, very slowly as the tan head was quite aggressive. Lots of lacing left as I sipped it down.
The aroma, even to my damaged nose was dark fruit and caramelized sugar and roasted malts. 
The taste was all that and more, the flavor just kept coming. The front was the sweet part and the middle the savory with the swallow bringing in the hops to keep it from going all mushy.

Consumed On: 08 March, 2023
Glass: Troeg's 0.4 L Tulip
ABV: 11%

Look: 
Clear amber with bubbles continuously rising. A 1-finger hight beige/light tan head quickly dissolves to a ring and filmy cover leaving OK lacing.

Aroma: 
Fruity, sweet, and a touch spicy. Tons of cherries with honey and candi sugar. A light note of cinnamon with a hint of cloves and some baking spices.

Taste: 
What is in the aroma is here. The sweet cherries and the candi sugar are more pronounced. The cinnamon and other spices are quite a bit sharper. The sip dries slightly and does not get cloying but it is certainly sweet and spicy. The alcohol is not hidden and provides a noticeable boozy note.

Feel: 
Sharp but also syrupy. Warm to hot from the alcohol. The body is medium-light.

Overall: 
This is not my favorite BDSA nor my favorite Troeg's offering, but this makes a decent winter warmer. If you like sweet, fruity, and boozy beers, this one is for you.

My ratings reflect this beer as Holiday beer or a Winter Warmer (which is what Mad Elf really is). I would rate this much lower as the BSDA that it is currently listed as."

3887,The Mad Elf,4.04,"(Freshest by 07/15/2023); Pours an opaque reddish copper into a Samuel Smith Imperial pint glass with a thin tannish head that fizzes and dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. Malts & cherry forward in the nose with a nice sweet earthy aroma to boot. Taste follows nose with a tart velvety finish. Very slight carbonation with the spicy Belgian yeast mid tongue, a syrupy mouth and noticeable alcohol burn, but hey @ 11% ABV it's hard to hide. This has been a staple in my beer fridge around the holidays for many moons. Always enjoy kicking back with a couple of these on cold winter nights."

3890,The Mad Elf,3.9,"1/14/23 poured from 12oz bottle purchased from Troegs gift shop.

Color is a beautiful reddish copper. 

Aroma: cherry, raisin, malt, honey. Dave can pick out the Belgian yeast!

Bright effervescence and smooth silkiness in the mouth

Taste is tart cherry, malt, clove, and it's boozy, almost ""hot""with alcohol. Slight metallic finish on the sides of the mouth. 

Not our favorite, but it's decent. Enjoy the mix they have on tap if the Grand Cacoa and Mad Elf."

Then it knocks you out. Same thing here. It says it's full of cherries and you say, well yeah it's probably a little tart but it's a belgian dark strong ale so giddy up. Then it knocks you out with tart cherries, and that 11%."

Tastes like nutty caramel, almond, walnut, chestnuts, lightly toasted brown bread, a hint of chocolate, toffee, subtle raisin, dried fruits, apple, apricot, some tobacco, woody cedar, pine resin, and herbal earthy hops.

Taste follows the nose with additional notes of dark fruits and a nice hop presence. Expected far more smokiness, seems more like a porter. Medium bodied, light side of medium carbonation, smooth mouth feel."
3934,Smoked Porter,4.13,"From a bottle brewed 12/27/15. Dark brown color with a thin layer of brown head. Roasted malt and vanilla smell. Feels a little thin. Roasted malt and smoke with some hop bitterness on the finish. Great flavor, wish the feel was a little bit heavier."

3937,Smoked Porter,3.92,"From notes 4/2/12: Pours dark brown with a ruby highlight when held to the light. The pour produces a frothy, tan, short-lived head that receded to nothing and left no lacing. Aroma is dark roast, dark fruit, chocolate, a little cherry and smoke. Taste is the same with heavier dark malt notes and a nice nuttiness with minor hop hints in the finish and a lingering bitter aftertaste. The level of smoke is a little disappointing. The taste is well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with nice carbonation, smooth and very drinkable."
3938,Smoked Porter,4.0,"Not as smoke forward as I like but still an undeniably good beer. It's a bit more on the traditional porter side, with a nice hop bite, caramel sweetness and deep roasted nut aroma. There's a light kiss of smoke but it makes you work for it. Unfortunately, although a good beer, when reaching for a smoky fix I go for O'Fallon's smoked porter, Yazoo Sue, or Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock."

3944,Obsidian Stout,5.0,"I like dark beers. I tried Coors Light...... once. Budwieser. Shitz. And the cheap ones make me ill. For me the yummy beers are dark, darker and darkest. Obsidian Stout tastes great and is definitely not less filling. I'm a one and done beer drinker so this one is perfect for me. If this beer isn't sold in Germany, it should be. I would take this beer over any Hefeweizen any day.

I noticed the label on the bottle I have is different from the label on the above photo however, the name is the same: Deshits, its dark and smelly too. It definitely tastes better than the Deshits name would suggest. I really like this beer."

3948,Obsidian Stout,3.75,
3949,Obsidian Stout,4.0,"Rated the same way I do Untappd. 

Poured into a tulip glass. 

Very dark in color. Tan head 

Coffee and subtle chocolate aroma. 

It's an ""old school"" stout. No big adjuncts. Big roasty character with espresso notes. But it doesn't finish with the really assertive coffee bitterness. It finishes a bit more smooth. I think maybe there are some chocolate notes that are helping accomplish that. Quite enjoyable. I tried it with some gouda cheese and it worked really well."

3954,Obsidian Stout,3.97,"Appearance: Pours a black cola color with brown hues. A small, khaki colored foam head. Lacks retention.

Aroma: Roasted malts, peanut shells, and bread. 

Taste: Roasted malts and a nice bitter hoppy bite up front, coffee, molasses, and a little bit of chocolate in the middle. Slightly biscuity and fades into a milder bitterness that lingers around in the finish. 

Overall: this is a pretty decent stout. The taste is surprisingly complex for the rather simple aroma."

3961,Black Tuesday,4.6,
3962,Black Tuesday,4.52,"Finally gotten my hands on a Black Tuesday. 2021 Version. 18.9% ABV

Pours out a very dark brown liquid with some translucence during the travel from the bottle to the glass. No foam whatsoever. No surprise there. There is a creamy appearance to it though. Like chocolate milk towards the center with more light penetration on the outer edges. 

Nose is straight up strong bourbon and oak against a huge roasted malt backdrop. Ethanol is defintely showing itself. Chocolate is prevalent here as well. Sweet confection, like a rich caramel, interacts with the chocolate and brightens it up. 

On the palate, we've got that huge bourbon for sure. Oak tannins are strong on this one. That chocolate shows up but gets overshadowed by both barrel influence and roasted malt. Some savory notes permeate this brew. This aspect always reminds me of well done street cart pretzels. On the back end there is a beautiful dark chocolate covered coffee bean note that lingers for quite some time. 

Mouthfeel brings heat not only from the ABV but the tannins as well. Hot and drying. Probably would be better off drinking this in the dead of winter, but alas, here I am in the dog days of summer. 

Overall, while I very much enjoyed this brew, the time its taken me to snag this bottle combined with the ever rising prices of, well everything, this one didn't quite live up to the reputation placed upon it. Perhaps I should have aged this one a little longer. Anyway, despite that, great brew, but other breweries do great things that are similar and less costly and even more available."
3963,Black Tuesday,4.3,"2021 can stored in a cooler. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass with a fizzy, one finger light khaki head that quickly dissipates to sparse patches with slight lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, bourbon, dry caramel, chocolate; boozy. Flavor is bourbon, dark toasted malt, bakers chocolate, raisins, dry caramel, oaky vanilla and a touch of licorice. Hot boozy bourbon finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess and sharp carbonation. I've tried a lot of bourbon barrel stouts in my day, and this is the most bourbon forward that I can remember; almost like a bourbon boilermaker that was extra heavy on the whiskey. Fortunately, there is a lot of flavor in the base too, with good chocolate and oak, some dark fruit and caramel that are more reminiscent of a blended strong ale. I was concerned with the fizzy pour, but despite the quick fade of the head, there is plenty of carbonation. There is a lot of intense flavor at the start of the taste, but the bourbon alcohol kicks in and dominates the finish; nice oak and bourbon in the lingering finish. The two years this can has on it has not seemed to mellow the flavor much (and if it has, glad I got an aged one). I expected a big, boozy stout and this delivered. It is a bit on the unbalanced side from the barrel effect, but enjoyable. I'm glad about the sensible 16oz. can over the traditional The Bruery 750s. Glad I had a chance to taste this classic."

3966,Black Tuesday,4.47,"Poured at 54°. Black body with some ruby see-through and good clarity; light brown rocky head dissolved quickly leaving no cap retention, ring nor lace; thick legs sheet the glass on swirl. Nose is bourbon and black licorice; boozy hot retro nasal; molasses as beer warms. Bourbon and bittersweet dark chocolate entry; oaky vanilla; molasses middle; hot phenolic finish. Hot mouth warmth from 18.9% abv; alcohol bite on tip and sides of tongue; full, non adjuncty body; silky feel, light carbonation; barrel dry finish. Overall, you better like boozy (and I do); layers of base and barrel flavors which are well balanced all but for the alcohol which is hot; dry oaky linger; definitely a beer to be enjoyed one sip at a time."
3967,Black Tuesday,3.53,"2014 Bruery Black Tuesday
19.7%

Seen these on shelves for $50 dollars and it honestly just tastes like Deths Tar just a bit thinner and a bit less sweety but more boozy even after 8+years .
Poured out very light brown( i expected a darker and thicker pour for obvious reasons)and settles dark brown into glass. No head whatsoever. A lil bit of bubbles swimmin up like salmon .

Tastes is dark chocolate, caramel , big dark fruit and heavily roasted malts with a harsh boozy finish. Nothing special.
Way too boozy as well. I feel the burn in my stomach from each sip and it gotten bit overwhelming after 4 sips.
Mouthfeel is too thin for the high abv in my opinion.

Always wanted to try this one and very happy I did. To whoever sent me this one a million thanks cuz Much happier i didn't get suckered in to paying what those bastards are asking for these bottles .

I'm not afan of The Bruery mainly cuz of the prices they charge( i get it gotta pay for barrel storage)and weird ass beers they make , but may buy one So Happens It's Tuesday once a year in pint can .

Overall I can see why no ones gives a fuck about these guys anymore. This is nothing special compared to a lot of stuff on shelves now and tastes way too hot even after 8 years. Makes sense why most members of their beerclub have 750s spoiling in their cellars cuz this is hard to finish and can't imagine getting through half the bottle alone.

Update : still have 1/3rd of the bottle in my fridge 3 days later cuz i didn't wanna drink anymore. 
The price they charge for these is a crime. 

Pro Tip: If you been wondering about this and don't wanna buy cuz of the price tag just buy a bottle of bourbon ... you'll be better off"
3968,Black Tuesday,4.64,"Sampled at Cigar City Brewing’s El Catador Club XV bottle share party.
2021 vint. 750 ml bottle.
Poured a hit into a logoed Cigar City taster’s glass. Little spritz of head doesn’t last at all. 
Smell is bourbon heavy chocolate, vanilla bean pod, prunes, vapor of alcohol.
Taste threw me back a step with a full assault of molasses, creme de cacao, dark malt, coffee and oak barrel.,. then the 19% ABV let me know who the boss is.
Feel is mighty mighty and thick. Tounge tar. Rich as Musk. Low carb. 
Overall, Damn. I stood there and refilled my 4 ounce taster’s glass couple of times more and had to go sit down. Drink some agua. Serious barrel aged Big Stout.,."

A: Pours an extremely dark brown hue with 1/2 inch fizzy dark mocha head that quickly recedes.
S: Dark chocolate, strong bourbon, brown sugar, vanilla, leather, and molasses.
T: Dark chocolate, a burst of dark dried fruit, bourbon, oak, vanilla, toasted caramel malt, crème brûlée, and a vinous note around the edges. With warming, anise and almond notes emerge.
M: Heavy body. Extremely smooth and supple feel. Layers of dark sweetness. Plush vinous feel too. A surprising bit of cola fizziness. Lingering spicy warmth. ABV is well hidden, but potent at 18.9%!

3978,Black Tuesday,4.59,"From the 750 ml bottle in a snifter via Bluejacket74! Many thanks for this beast!
This monster pours a dark brownish black with a moderate head of light brown 
foam that settles to a thick ring that dissipates to a thin ring with no lacing....but
give it a swirl and this one has some nice legs! Bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark roasted
goodness, dark bakers chocolate, dark coffee, raisins, and astringent booze notes. 
Flavors nail it! Dark bakers chocolate in bathed in rich bourbon, vanilla, oak, rich
char, dark berry notes of blackberry and raspberry, brewers licorice, and dark bread. 
Excellent mouth feel for such a beast-----smooth, rich, coating, full body, light 
carbonation with subtle lift, and a warming, bourbon forward, bitter roasted
malt finish that is medium dry.

Overall-----phew! What a brew!

Cheers"

3992,Shock Top Belgian White,2.93,
3993,Shock Top Belgian White,3.15,"12oz can

On the pour not even 1 finger of average white head formed then in under a minute it completely dissipates. Despite that and my clean glass, bubbles cling to the side of the glass from excessive carbonation. Hazy golden orange body.

Aroma is light for the style with hints of citrus, but no coriander. A touch metallic with a grainy finish.

Taste is decent, with some nice but subtle orange flavor right in front of an almost sweet, wheaty malty body. A touch doughy. Really not bad, but not quite a full on belgian wit.

Feel is highly carbonated and very refreshing. Much better when poured in a glass than when left in the can. At first it seems like its going to be full bodied, but the body quickly drops off as a dryness sets in. The wheat flavor stacks around for the finish, but this gets light fast. Basically a lawnmower beer.

Overall this is decent for an AB product, but it's too expensive for what it is. I don't get any coriander, and the orange basically replaces any hop character. Not bad to change up the pace from lagers, but not something to give a shot if youn are looking for a quality Belgian style Wit."

The aroma has notes of citrus, and less pronounced notes of cloves and banana. There are also some less pleasant hints of solvent. The flavour is also citrussy, with moderate notes of banana and cloves. Fizzy mouthfeel. 

Original rating: 355 ml bottle, at Peter Gift, Aarhus, Denmark. Deep golden colour, no head at all in the shiny glass, probably due to the pub’s ignorant use of rinse aid / rinse agent.

4042,Daisy Cutter,3.76,"Poured from a freshness dated 16 oz. can: slightly hazy, deep golden-orange with a sustained, foamy white head.

The aroma is mainly tropical fruit and some faint pine. 

The first sip, just after pouring into the glass, nearly took my head off because it was so bracingly bitter and seemed very thin-bodied. Please let this one warm in the glass for a few minutes before quaffing as it will calm the bitterness and give flavors of bittersweet tropical fruit and mango as well as hints of pine. This one drinks like an IPA to me. I prefer my pales ales less bracing with a well-rounded body. I'm still glad I tried it."
4043,Daisy Cutter,3.83,
4044,Daisy Cutter,3.92,"Can dated 7/6 (month-plus):
Pours a amber nearing copper with a near clear body and a bunch of head. Lacing is a bit clumpy, but pretty strong. Nose seems trying to throw a little citrus into a grassy bitterness along with some grain dry toast. Taste opens with a bit of a grain tea from lightly toasted malts. This doesn't last too long on a cold beer, but lingers longer on a warming beer. Grassy notes from the aroma grow out of this fairly steadily and into full strength at the finish. A copper note leaks in on a cold beer, but isn't really noticed at all at the preferred temp. The beer is pretty dry, which seems to accentuate the bitterness, which turns a bit dank at the end and in the finish. This offering from Half Acre has more of an old school IPA vibe to it than an actual IPA of theirs I recently tried."

Aroma of unoffensive pine and citrus zest.
Taste bursts low and kinda dank. A wave of malt is in the mix. Nice balanced finish. Mmmm., really good dry finish. 
Mouthfeel is narrow, center of the tongue. Medium carbonation suits it well.
Overall, a ‘little’ beer that delivers a satisfying six minutes worth of your time."

4053,Daisy Cutter,2.92,"This was from a bar, so it may have been served too cold. It has a transparent amber color, with a mix of hop and malt aroma. However, I don't taste much. There's a bit of watered down sweetness, but that's about all she wrote. For such a highly rated beer, I'm disappointed."
4054,Daisy Cutter,3.56,"This is a review of a 16 oz can. From the bottom of the can: ""030 123B 3145 14:51 N95""

Appearance: The body of the beer is a darker shade of amber. It has pretty good clarity with only a slight bit of haze. There is a medium-large sized head which appears mostly white with a touch of a tan hue to it. It has excellent head retention which is probably the greatest feature of the appearance. The head overall looks really good on this beer. There are a few splotches of lacing that form on the glass but not many and they are separated quite a bit.

Aroma: There is a light but present aroma of pine with a touch of caramel. A bit of an orange aroma comes through as well, which blends with the caramel scent. It smells nice.

Taste: Up front there is a candied orange peel flavor with a touch of caramel. The middle of the palate has a biscuit flavor mixed with notes of lemon and lime. It has a touch of alcohol flavor and a bit of grass near the back of the palate. Some pine, grass, and a light bit of alcohol in the aftertaste. There is also a nice lemon and lime flavor in the aftertaste but it comes in after the other flavors fade out a bit.

Mouthfeel: It has a medium perceived hop bitterness with a bit of a resinous texture to a body which feels medium-light at some points and medium at others. It is more textured and weighty than a standard Pale Ale. It also feels like the bitterness is stronger than average. It is still enjoyable to drink and it seems to fit this beer.

Overall: The can states that this is a ""PALE ALE"" and doesn't appear to list an ABV. It is a nice beer that seems to drink a bit more like an IPA than a Pale Ale. It will definitely deliver some nice flavors like the biscuit character, some pine, some orange, and other citruses like lemon and lime. It also is a bit grassy and comes through with alcohol character. If you are an IPA lover who is looking for something with similar characteristics in a Pale Ale then you will probably enjoy this. 

If you enjoy a more tame and drinkable Pale Ale this might not be for you. I could drink it again but it wouldn't replace a standard Pale Ale if that was what I was looking for. This might be something I would buy if I wanted an IPA but wanted it to be lower ABV."
4055,Daisy Cutter,3.71,
4056,Daisy Cutter,3.83,"I guess I was expecting more. It is not my favorite pale ale. Poured from a 2 month old can into a Sam Smiths pint glass, it produced a good, but short lived head. There is something kind of funky about the finish, but the initial taste is pretty good."
4057,Daisy Cutter,3.77,"Appearance: pours a pale golden color with a sticky off-white foam head.

Aroma: citrus, pine, and caramel malts.

Taste: follows the nose. Citrus peel, a little bit of pine and some caramel malts, well balanced. Some some moderate bitterness that lingers into the finish.

Overall: This is a pretty solid pale ale. It's simple The characteristics in both the aroma and taste are well balanced. This one kills it with the drinkability."
4058,Daisy Cutter,4.59,
4059,Daisy Cutter,4.15,"Imperial Pint (Stovepipe) presumably canned on January 5th 2023, hopefully this isn't a best by, but if it is Please let me know.

On the pour a very nice 5 finger white sudsy head formed then over a couple minutes the bubble got bigger and the head lost 2 fingers, so head retention is pretty good here. Body is a clear golden yellow, legit pale ale look. Sudsy lacing forms.

Aroma is basically a bright slightly citrusy pine forest with hints of sweet wort and caramel malts. Super fresh and smells like pellet hops I've used while homebrewing. Perhaps an American and noble hop mix? Definitely fruity, but herbal as well.

Taste follows the aroma, but is more bitter than a lot of NEIPAs out there. I can see why the American Pale Ale style is falling by the wayside in favor of session hazies. This is essentially a full flavored ""session"" WCIPA in terms of the bitterness, but being called a ""simple"" pale ale is still appropriate as after the citrusy and resinous bitter hops a lightly toasted and sweet malt backbone makes itself known. I'm honestly upset IPAs are taking over pale ales, since the latter is basically a balanced but bitter WCIPA when compared to a hazy/NEIPA. Anyways, I enjoyed this beer quite a lot. Hoppy but balanced by actual detectable malts. This is what craft beer was aiming to be about 10 years ago before everyone got bored of ""beer flavor"".

Feel is full without being heavy. Feels similar to a 6% ABV IPA despite the lower ABV. Full malty body with light astringency in the medium long finish. Dries out over the course of a drink.

Overall I greatly appreciate the balance of malt and hops here. This is what I always imagined ""malt backbone"" meant, but I''ve always been a malthead. At the same time, there is a solid resinous and grapefruit pith-y hop bitterness. Caramel malt sweetness without being even an amber beer. Good stuff."

The taste features malts galore, cocoa and chocolate and coffee and toast and the expected sweetness was present, just not as a major player.
The feel was a bit thin for a stout, especially a double, but as the ABV makes it possible to drink more than one without falling over, the thinness works in its favor.

4075,Special Double Cream Stout,3.87,"12 oz bottle
Glass: Nonic Pint
Temp at Pour: 47 F
ABV: 6.1%


Look:
Very dark brown-to-black with some chestnut highlights when held up to a light. 1-finger dark tan/light brown head that quickly dissipates to a thing cover and then that begins to disappear. I suspect that the age of this bottle is a factor, here.

Smell: 
Sweet roasted oats and rich semi-sweet chocolate. Touch of coffee here and there.

Taste: 
Initial molasses sweetness is quickly joined by roasted oats and some char. The semi-sweet chocolate appears and transitions to bittersweet chocolate and obvious coffee notes emerge. Anise shows up near the end. Finishes on a sweet fading chocolate and molasses note.

Feel: 
Smooth and creamy. Body is in the heavier side of medium

Overall: 
This stout is a perennial favorite of mine. I pick up at least a 6 pack each year, if I can. The coffee and chocolate notes remind of coffee stouts, but are much less in your face. The heavier body is nice. Somehow, this particular bottle hid in the cellar for 2 years. It didn't last long after I found it."

S - notes of semi sweet chocolate, roasted dark malts, coffee - smell is somewhat faint 
T - follows the nose with semi sweet chocolate and roasted dark malts intermixed with sweet cream and coffee along with a somewhat nutty finish
F - medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. Smooth and velvety, but a little thin on the finish 
O - a nice milk stout that doesn't really do anything wrong."
4077,Special Double Cream Stout,3.62,"Poured gently from a bottle into a snifter glass, forming maybe a finger of tan head. Deep cola brown color. Smell is sweet/roasty oats. Taste is similar to the taste, just mostly roasty with some sweetness. Taste got a bit much after it warmed, wasn't a fan at all at that point. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A fine milk stout if you like the roasty nature."
4078,Special Double Cream Stout,3.42,
4079,Special Double Cream Stout,5.0,"It's a very good, strong and sweet stout, with the heavier body and roasty characteristics you'd expect from a stout, magnified with the extra maltiness and higher abv of a double stout. The hop, malt, roast and sweet flavors are well balanced, and overall, it's just all around an excellent beer.

On the newer brown label, the words ""Double Cream"" are larger than the rest of the name, so the two of us read that as ""doubly sweet stout"" rather than ""sweet double stout"", which is what it actually is - a maltier, stronger version of a sweet stout. It's still a cream stout so of course it is sweet, but it's not dessert levels of sweetness, which is good, in my opinion.

In other words, a Cream Stout is a sweet stout, and a Double Stout is a stronger, maltier stout, so this Double Cream Stout is both of those put together. It makes sense in hindsight :)

I've liked pretty much every beer I've tried from Bell's, although they're the most expensive 6-packs you can buy (around here at least). When other craft beers were $10 for a 6-pack, Bell's 6-packs were $17, so I normally never buy them."

4083,Curieux,4.1,"Very deceptive, very tasty...

When I see a brew is barrel-aged, at 10.5%, and it has a taste that hints of the booze - I found it very deceptive, in a good way. The booze that I expected to taste and even smell - was basically non-existent. I find this to be well made for that fact alone. A tasty treat indeed that I would be glad to try once again."
4084,Curieux,4.34,"Poured from a can into a tulip glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden color with a small white foam. The head has a fantastic level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving tons of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is big and bold with lots of candied sugar and biscuit malt. Mixed with these aromas comes a nice doughy smell mixed with lots of coriander and clove, along with a bit of nutmeg. At the same time notes of yeast and some peach and lychee are there as well. For a bourbon barrel aged brew, the bourbon smell is light, but adds a nice accent, mixing with the rest to produce a rather inviting smell.
Taste – The taste begins with a nice crisp cracker and biscuit malt flavor mixed with some sweet grape, peach, and apricot flavors as well as flavors of candied sugar and yeast cake. Along with these flavors comes a decent showing of coriander and clove, with some lighter notes of white pepper and grain. As the taste advances the sweeter flavors get stronger, with some bubblegum and cane sugar joining in. At the same time a bit of grass and hay join in, and with a touch of bourbon coming on at the end, one is left with a nice, sweet, crisp, and flavorful triple like flavor to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is light for a 10.5 % abv brew, with a carbonation level that is high and effervescent. For the style and the taste, the feel is great and makes for a very pleasant sipper.
Overall – While not very heavy on the bourbon at all, the brew is rather flavorful and tasty. A very nice, slightly sweeter sipper, and one certainly worth a try."

4086,Curieux,3.84,"Interesting idea to barrel age a tripel, and the barrel notes are quite nice. However, I find the overall flavor profile lacks many of the qualities I'm looking for from a solid Belgian tripel in addition to being a bit too boozy for the style."
4087,Curieux,4.5,"Pours a gorgeous slightly unfiltered golden color with a creamy white head that yields to the body of the beer fairly quickly. Beautiful tripel. The nose is crammed full of oak notes, with caramel and vanilla in plentiful amounts and a bit of bourbon and pear. I am literally drooling.

That oak flavor is forward and melds well with the caramel and vanilla to provide a smooth foundation for the bourbon to provide a modest amount of booziness, but it’s the pear at the back of the palate that is knocking my beer nerd socks off. So many flavors and so well balanced.

The mouthfeel is substantial and fairly crisp, making for an oxymoron of a beer - a crushable 10.2% ABV beer. This is exceptionally well crafted and a world class tripel that I am so glad I finally had the opportunity to enjoy."

4089,Curieux,4.5,"lovely beer, citrusy spicey taste. scotch and lemon peel. very fresh for a tripel"
4090,Curieux,4.25,"Looks like a lager, but don't be fooled! The nose has a noted alcohol hit and the flavor is just a touch of classic belgian maltiness with an big dose of bourbon, like someone had dumped a shot in the pint! A non-funky, but still distinctive beer I'd recommend trying."
4091,Curieux,4.25,"This one has been on my list to try for a while. It's a tripel aged in barrels, which I guess converts it to a Belgian pale ale. Pours paler than expected. Fizzy and quick dissipating foam. Smells of cloves and typical Belgian smells. But then you get the whiff of the whiskey barrel. It’s like drinking Earlytimes on the rocks after all the ice has melted. And that's actually excellent. The barrel is pretty prominent especially in such a pale beer. You also get notes of vanilla and toffee(?). This is definitely a unique beer and glad I got to try it. Label is okay. A bit boring and generic but also dignified. It's fine."

Undated bottle. Served at 53.7 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 58.1 degrees. 
Appearance – 3.5.
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear.
Body – Brown (SRM 20), opaque. Under direct light, same, but much precipitate is present. When rear lite, opaque except at the edges – ruby and translucent. 
Head – Average (Maximum 1.2 cm, aggressive center pour), brown sugar, high density with many surface rocks, quickly diminishing to a 0.35 – 0.5 cm low-density crown and a thin island.
Lacing – Surprisingly, a fair amount, extremely tiny bubbles forming a few small coronas. More than expected at 11% ABV.
Aroma – 4.5 – Chocolate, weak char, and a hint of coffee. No hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.5 – Chocolate and slight char with a slightly bitter aftertaste. No hops or yeast. No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. Slight gastric warming occurs. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. 
Palate – 4 – Full, dry, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4 (After deducting 0.25 point for undated personal container) Looks like every other RIS. Drinkability excellent, with nose and taste balanced, very smooth! Palate works well with the flavor."

Smell: Getting big notes of chocolate - rich baking chocolate. Getting some caramel and toffee as well as some molasses too. Not to much on the coffee notes here or bourbon/whiskey either.
Taste: First you get a coffee aromic taste followed by the chocolatey that backs it up. The thing that stands out the most is definitely the chocolate. I'm getting hints of oaky-ness and vanilla as well. It's rich yet not to heavy in a sense that you can drink it easily. The alcohol is very well hidden and that's surprising being a 11.8% beer. I didn't get much of a whiskey taste in this and this might be due to ageing it for months in a barrel vs some places do years. Even though the whiskey/ bourbon barrels aren't to present but it's a very good sipper.
Feel: This is so smooth that you can't even tell it's a heavy beer. It's not chewy or oily at all, very light carbonation - might throw a lot of people off by this alone yet so smooth. Easy sipper for sure.
Overall: I was hesitant paying the price for a four pack but man I'm glad I got to experience this. I'll definitely be buying again and even aging some to see how it turns out."

Taste is not as carbonated as I thought, a light chocolate than anticipated and the coffee is likewise present, but subdued. None of this is truly as bad as it sounds, but is noticeable. This is very pleasant and for this ABV, very drinkable. An easy to like imperial stout."
4136,Big Bad Baptist,3.8,"Rel #101. Pours a dark, dark brown with a faint hint of red. Fully opaque in the glass, with a think khaki colored head that quickly receded to a long-lasting cap. Aroma is really nice. Rich chocolate dominates, while the coffee and whiskey barrels have faded. 

Taste is almost the opposite of the nose. No direct coffee notes, but plenty of roast and some really nice barrel flavors. There's not much in the way of sweetness, but that's not at all a bad thing. This beer is several years old, and while I can't attest to what it tastes like fresh, it has a certain balanced mellowness to it that I'm really enjoying. Full bodied and smooth going down."

L - Beautiful ruby red color and very clear. Light tan head fades quickly to a thick ring around the glass and a few wisps on the surface. Swirling the beer reveals light lacing and ""legs"" on the glass like a strong wine shows.

S - Nose is an interesting blend of sweet brown ale with red wine and berry notes, and a sharp, acidic note with some barnyard funk at a low level.

T - The barnyard funk and sour acidity dominate the flavors, but is some depth that reveals other flavors. I get blackberry jam and oak, but the base of Flemish brown ale is not detectable to me.

F - Thin body with low carbonation. Hops bitterness is not detectable because the acidic sourness is so strong it masks any other sensation on the tongue. It also give a sharp bite in the throat. Alcohol presence is also drowned out by the acid, except for some esters detectable in the finish. 

O - This is an unabashedly funky and sour beer, but totally over the top compared to the Belgian versions of Flemish Brown I've had. Still, this does have delicate touches that make it more than just a sour monster."

At 5.7% it is perfect for summertime drinking. Pale Ale are my favorite beers. If you're a pale ale fan, then take it from me, this is good."

L: Orangish-yellow, a touch cloudy, small white head (probably subdued by the server) fades to a ring in less than a minute,
S: Bright hoppy aroma, mostly citrus, almost juicy.
T: Hoppy, subtle orange flavor, pine comes through later in the glass, enough malt to balance the clean zesty bitterness.
F: Crisp feel, gives an overall light impression but does have a bit of heft, not thin or weak.
O: Quality APA, more American traditional but has some limited juicy character, haven’t had this out of a bottle, or can but this draft pour is pretty good."

4184,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.42,"Sam Adams Cherry wheat is a decent seasonal beer. Granted you can find it on the shelves outside the fall & winter months, but it really belong there. It’s not nearly as refreshing drinking it on a hot summer day as opposed to a chilly fall or winter day/night. 

It has a bite when first taking a mouthful, but finishes nicely. The cherries are noticeable at first, but after having more than one beer in a given setting you don’t really notice the cherry taste anymore. Hence it’s not very vibrant it’s just there. It also sits on the heavier side too so a 6 pack is generally enough for any one given person at a time."

This is hands down the best cherry beer I can drink all day, or if I had to pick one cherry beer.. this is the one I would drink many times. For sure. Most other cherry beer is tart and not sweet...this one is like if a normal light American lager had a hybrid with a bit of cherry coke just for some smooth lager cherry flavor. I have bought many times, very rarely is it a bad batch. Would recommend."
4188,Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.62,"12oz bottle, tulip, best by May 2023. An office Christmas gift as part of a mixed six. 

The color is rather golden, with perhaps a nod of pink, though that could simply be the suggestion. The head was average and not long lasting. 

I smell beer and cherry smoothie. I find the cherry aroma pleasant and real, though it’s more like real cherry ice cream or a smoothie than fresh cherries. Sweet, creamy, fruity, small tang. 

The taste very much follows; cherry yogurt, pale wheat ale base. There is some bitterness to the finish, which is mostly clean with a lingering sweetness like from one of them flavored sparkling waters that’re all the rage. 

Moderate body and carbonation. You can tell there’s wheat in it by a slight matte feel to it. 

I’m a bit surprised given the reputation this beer at least used to have on this site. I’d say a good word to describe it is “pleasant”, as long as you’re in the mood for something light and fruity. C’mon, it’s clearly for non-beer drinkers or beginners."

Beer pour dark brown with a beautiful nitro like mocha head that has some nice hang time.

Nose has hints of coffee and mildly roasted malts.

Taste is a mildly roasted malt base with the coffee adjunct blended it subtlety. Finishes with a touch of cream and is well balanced with no sign of coffee astringency.

Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and smooth.

Overall a really nice job of incorporating the coffee adjunct. Can see my self picking this up a few times a year!"

Smell: Raspberry and pretty strong tartness.

Taste: Tart and acidic with the raspberries in the background. Mix of tart and raspberries in the finish. Light bodied.

Overall: The other mainstay fruit beer from New Glarus, Raspberry Tart follows its name and provides a tart raspberry experience. I would have preferred more raspberry and less tart, but oh well. I prefer the Belgian red."
4221,Raspberry Tart,4.7,"(12 oz bottle, obtained at the brewery two days ago... poured into a clear, plastic cup)

Cloudy, raspberry red liquid; some lasting foam in the form of a collar... redolent raspberry on the nose... raspberry pie on the palate, fruit and dough; approaching fruit shrub in its acidity; mesmerizing dimension and expression of the raspberry flavor... the tart tingle invigorates my senses; its body has a lazy plushness to it, almost but not quite nectary... an aptly named beer; this was my first time having it in about 9 years, and I was in heaven; looking forward to sharing some with friends back home (2186)"

4234,Raspberry Tart,4.7,"Poured from a 12-ounce bottle into a Zwanze 2018 logo stemmed goblet because it seemed like the right thing to do. The color approximates a murky and slightly watered-down cola, with a short snow-white head that left lots of spotty lacing. No question in my mind as to why this is among the top-rated beers of its style. It's fruit forward, with lovely aromas of raspberry jam balanced with notes of light breadiness. It's sweet, but not cloying. It's tart, but not overpowering. It has good carbonation and very low bitterness. It finishes perfectly dry. This made an ideal pairing with grilled chicken, and I could imagine that it would be absolutely stellar with crackers and aged Wisconsin cheddar. The only downside is that it's available only in Wisconsin, but who doesn't like a nice road trip once in a while?"

4236,Raspberry Tart,4.15,"This is very close to what I imagine a raspberry soft drink would taste like. It's very sweet, which in my opinion is the biggest downside, but otherwise is an amazing beer. Definitely more sweet than a typical fruit lambic or the belgian red."

S: Malt, chocolate.

T: Roasted malt, hint of chocolate, jam, and a bit bready. Thin.

F: Medium-bodied, pretty light. Some carbonation, crisp. Not similar to other imperial stouts.

O: Imperial stout at 7%. Just about sums it up. It's not a bad beer per se, but it follows the original English tradition, which is to say lighter, less body, not as complex. There are better stout options available."

4249,Imperial Stout,3.37,"A: Pours up a deep reddish mahogany with a frothy three-finger beige head, medium retention, nice lacing. 

S: Immediate notes of chocolate followed my more muted hints of roasted malt, specifically not coffee but roasted malt, though some slight coffee notes do come out a little bit later, as do some biscuity notes and some subtle hints of vanilla.   

T: A warm bready sweetness greets you, followed by a somewhat jammy malt flavor that hints at chocolate without quite getting there, this is rounded out by some subtle hints of roasted malt and a crisp, slightly tart finish. 

M: On the lighter end of medium body, slightly over carbonated and a bit dry. 

O: This is a very good beer, but to me it suffers from what I might call “OG Syndrome”. What I mean by this is that how this style is understood has changed since this beer was first brewed but this beer largely has not, leading to a beer that misses the mark by no fault of its own. The beer has a surprisingly light body that one would not think of when one thinks of the style, and the dryness and carbonation are unwelcome by modern standards as well. I do enjoy this, but were I reaching for an imperial stout this would not be my first choice. It’s a bit too understated."

F-Medium bodied mouthfeel. Decently high carbonation.
O-Ehh. I don't really get the hype with this beer. It's solid, but there isn't anything to write home about. For a surprisingly low ABV imperial stout, there was still a good bit of boozeyness on the pallet. Just an okay beer. Not sure if I'd try again."

Pours a cloudy deep orange amber with 2 fingers of light tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

It doesn’t have all that much presence in the nose, but what’s there is pretty good. I’m picking up on aromas of biscuity malt, floral hops, lemon zest, honey, and light pepper

It’s a bit more expressive in taste, but still not a punch in the face or anything. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting herbal hops, crackery malt, honey, orange zest, and green tea. The swallow brings notes of black tea, floral hops, biscuity malt, honey, toasted grain, and light orange

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry but a bit watery

4323,Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.9,"Re-reviewing this one as it’s been a dozen years since I last reviewed it.

12oz can (5/16/2023) into a tulip. Pours a clear amber color with a huge billowing almost Duvel-like eggshell head with lots of sticky lace. 

Aroma is hoppy and grassy, floral. Piney Northwest hops, fragrant sweet malt. 

Taste is a blend of bready caramel malt and floral hops; light bitterness. Clean water. Nicely balanced. Very old school. 

Mouthfeel is soft, medium bodied, crisp, drinkable. Something about it is vaguely reminiscent of beers brewed with Belgian yeast.

Overall a tasty, classic approach to the APA, one of my first go-to beers from the ‘90s. It’s somehow comforting to know that beers like this are still being made.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4
On tap in an American pint glass at Bick's Broadview Grill. Review from memory (less than 30 minutes ago).

Color is a slightly hazy copper with a beautiful 1-finger head, good carbonation.

Aroma is floral and herbal hops.

Taste is floral, bitter hops with a nice pale malt balance. This beer straddles the line between a pale ale and an IPA. Used to drink this often and it's been way too long.

Overall this is a good example of a Northwest-style pale ale, generous with the hops and always refreshing."

Nearly clear, deep gold colored body. One finger of white head, which settles back to a thin cap and ring. Leaves behind strings and spots of lacing.
Aroma of toasted malt, with hops expressing the flavors of citrus and grass.
Taste has a solid malt base. Citrus flavors of orange and lemon. Slightly spicy. Grass. Floral.
Medium mouth feel, which is substantial. Some tongue sting. Very good carbonation.

This is Cantillon’s most popular beer, and I’m somehow only getting to it now. I was originally intending to just buy another bottle of Fou Foune from MBC, but when I saw the seller had this one available for a good price I figured I had to get it. Let’s pop it open and see what it has to offer

Pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

There's a lot of funk in the nose here, but it's very well integrated. i'm picking up on aromas of wet hay, sharp oak, lemon zest, wildflower honey, crabapple, white wine vinegar, white pepper, light cracker, and pear

The funk is certainly more aggressive in taste, though it's more than welcome here. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, earthy wheat, sharp oak, white wine vinegar, crabapple, pear skin, wet hay, jammy apricot, and white pepper. The swallow brings notes of lemon juice, wildflower honey, crabapple, sharp oak, white wine vinegar, pear skin, jammy apricot, earthy wheat, tobacco, light cracker, and a touch of smoke

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet slick beer. Finishes oddly sticky but eventually dries out

This is wonderful, but I'm honestly a bit surprised that it's not super dry. The sticky finish takes away from the experience a bit, but overall it's still a great expereince"
4341,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.5,"750 ml bottle split with my wife, poured into red wine glasses. 2019 vintage. This is a wonderfully complex gueuze. Green apple, plentiful but not overwhelming acidity, leather funk, oak tannins, and a hint of vinegar are the primary flavor notes. Mouthfeel has average carbonation and a dry finish. Stellar."
4342,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.34,"750ml bottle poured into tulip. Date on bottle says December of '21.

Pours a deep golden orange with half a finger of dirty white head that leaves clouds of lace as it recedes.

Smells of white wine vinegar, sour green apples, zesty oranges, juicy stone fruit, barrel wood and some lacto funk.

Tastes more fruit-forward. Apricot, pineapple, sour apple, navel orange, more sharp vinegar, barnyard funk and barrel staves.

Feels smooth and delicate. Light bodied with soft carbonation. Finishes sour and fruity.

Verdict: Vigorously recommended. World class for sure."

4346,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.49,"2,500th review! It's only been 9.5 years. Super excited to try this legendary Cantillon as I've been sitting on it for a few months hoping for a milestone brew. 2021 bottling and purchased from Durand for a small but worthwhile fortune. My first Loon. Served cold into a goblet.

Appearance - Picturesque bright golden color with a small amount of haze. A finger of small soapy cap that continues to fizzle on as more head forms from the bubbles rising in the glass.

Smell - Tartness with subtle bits of cherry, apple skins, woody and slightly musty barrel, some earthy funk. There's sort of a deep underlying sweetness there too that ties all the aromas together.

Taste - A little sourness and green apple tartness. Elements of wood and musty barrel. Light grapey qualities too. Funky without being too far out in left field. Cohesive in the flavors. A slightly spicy element in the aftermath maybe. As it warms the woody barrel note seems to be elevated with a trace of honey. Depth of flavor is awesome and lingers on really well in the aftertaste,

Mouthfeel - Medium-light body, good expressive carbonation and very dry finish.

Overall - Awesome sour beer, the depth is unreal and it's difficult to decipher everything you're tasting. Super stoked to have finally tried this and boy does it ever live up to expectations. One of my best new beers of 2022 and a very worthy milestone brew. Absolutely worth trying if you can a) find it and b) afford it."

4348,Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.49,"September 2021 bottle.

Looks: Slightly cloudy orange/gold, no head or legs.

Smells: Sour and funky, lots of fruit for an unfruited lambic (bacteria are amazing, hey?). I get apricot, orange zest, citron, green apple, pineapple, wood, a bit of bread, and apple cider vinegar levels of fermentation. 

Tastes: Similar to the nose but less fruity, mostly apricot, citrus, and green apple plus the woodiness and bready malt, with the sourness and funk being more prominent. Gave me a big initial pucker but was smooth after. 

Feels: Nice medium body, a slight fuzzy carbonation that doesn't linger very long.

Overall: Heck yeah. Awesome gueuze, lives up to the Cantillon hype even if it's not mind-blowing."

Appearance: A mostly clear golden orange colour with a big two finger white head that had pretty good retention and eventually settled to a thin cap while leaving some nice lacing.

Aroma: Sour, tart, funky, musty, wet wood, green apple, grapefruit zest, with a touch of white grapes.

Taste: Sour, tart, slightly sweet, funky, oak, apricot, with some light lemon zesty notes.

Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: A nice enjoyable easy to drink gueuze. Perfect for a hot summer day."

My first Cantillon offering, and shared with a couple friends at Monk's Cafe in Philly. Absolutely a must try for any beer enthusiast."

Aroma is lightly tart and fruity like white grapes, wheat, honey.
Fresh, bright, and light - feels like summer in an orchard; reminiscent of spanish sidre, with flavours of crisp sweet/tart apples and hay, with a whisper of funk, a light lactic tang, the freshest mountain water, oak; it's the perfect level of sourness, enough to make you smack your lips, but not pucker; the finish is dry and flavour lingers; the feel is prickly and finely effervescent, medium bodied, crisp yet silky.

Beautiful in it's simplicity and refinement. Not particularly complex, it is pure and deftly crafted, and approachable."

Russian River Brewing
Date: 08 May 2020
Drinking through one of the lists on BeerAdovcate, this beer is next on the docket. I served the beer in a chalice around 46 degrees. The pour created a massive two-fingered creamy but airy white head. The retention is excellent, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 8, dark golden yellow with amber hues. The clarity is clear with loads of carbonation. A beautiful appearance. 

The aromas in the beer are cloves, phenols, floral, toasted crackers, banana, a touch of funk, and earthiness. 

I taste cloves, phenols, floral, herbal, green grass, toasted crackers, bready, a hint of funk, orange, banana, and earthiness.

The mouthfeel is dry and spicy. 

The body is medium, has high carbonation, and has a lasting finish. 

I was expecting a big, malty, and spicy Belgium beer. I got a lighter malty Belgium Beer with a dry, spicy finish. A unique take on this style. I enjoyed the differences in this beer."

4376,Damnation,3.03,"I should issue a caveat. The bottle shop had this labeled as a Russian Imperial Stout. You stout drinkers can imagine my disappointment. 
It is not that this beer is bad. Looks, smells, tastes and feels like a Belgian. Not a particularly good one so I’m surprised by the ratings. It’s spicy banana Belgian blah blah boredom all day long. Almost as if someone said, “let’s brew a prototypical Belgian.” And strong ale? At 7.5%? I have had abbey ales at 10%+ with heavy duty sediments and incredibly complex flavors. Those are Belgian strong ales. Duvel, though decidedly weaker than some, is light years beyond this. The temerity!"

4379,Damnation,4.23,"Inspired by Duvel in style, Damnation exudes the Sonoma terroir: winey, yet wonderfully dry.
The yeast reminds me of Belgium's passionate pints, particularly how the yeast works up the malts. And a dash of pepper. Spritzy.

Because Russian River produces mostly world-class Wilds (and I shy from the style), I am glad to see their excellence applied to the BSPA. Preceded by two Bay Area cheeses, Damnation went wonderfully with an impromptu pasta dish with butter and Italian parsley."

4382,Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.44,"Beautiful looking beer on the pour....gold color, big white head and lots of fluffy lacing. Aroma is fresh bread. Taste is wonderfully bold and fruity (citrus, banana, dried fruits), but the finish is creamy smooth.

Some sticky lacing left behind in the glass. Smell is banana, clove, ripe apple, a slight citrus smell. Taste starts sweet and fruity with apple, banana, citrus up front. Middle of the sip tastes of clove, pepper, more banana. Finish is spicy with pepper up front, clove and allspice mixed in, maybe some cinnamon, and a long banana, clove, wheat cracker, peppery aftertaste. Feel is medium to full bodied, with a nice tight carbonation, almost coats the tongue. Feel is very smooth and easy to drink with a bit of alcohol warming in the end. Overall, wow!

On a hard pour a good amount of head formed filling most of the glass, retention was decent, but after getting distracted the head was thin, but maintained a cap, then I poured the rest. Lacing forms at an average rate. Very hazy golden yellow body.

Aroma is real almost fresh, lemon juice, which I appreciate a lot actually. A bit of sweet malt sits right behind the fresh lemon aroma bringing a definite sweetness.

Taste isn't quite as bright as the aroma, eith zero tartness and a zesty lemon flavor that quickly leads into a sweet, malty and wheaty, but also plain American wheat beer base. Essentially zero hops. I want either more beer or more tartness from the lemons. This comes off as a bit sweet, but still has a refreshing summery character.

The feel is actually quite nice. Outside on a hot day, straight out of the can, this is fantastic, but other than being a fancy easy to drink and maybe even chuggable lawnmower beer, it isn't really even worth it to pour in a glass. No wo der they only make it during summer.

Overall this beer is very setting dependent. Out of the can while outside, this is a great radler, but out of a glass with dinner its a bit sweet and lacking in tartness for being a lemon radler."

Nose features clove, banana, and honey. Delightful.

Overall, this is a really nice porter with a strong hop presence, yet it still remains rather well- balanced."
4450,Anchor Porter,4.72,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.
The body is inky black with a half inch of brown head with a mild pour. Retention is average.
The intensity of aroma is medium. There are notes of malt, salted toffee, rich dark chocolate and black coffee. It smells wonderful. 
The intensity of taste is medium high with a dryer and more hoppy flavor than the aroma suggests. Normally, I loath hoppy porters, but Anchor got this one right. With a swallow, the flavor keeps going. There are flavors of toffee, deep dark chocolate, more black coffee than in the aroma and a long pronounced hoppy flavor that's medium in intensity. It's rich and delicious. I've missed having a go to dark beer after New Castle changed. This will likely be it's much better replacement. I usually support local Austin breweries, but this is a much better beer than 512 Pecan Porter which is much more expensive for a four-pack compared to a six-pack of this.
The thickness is just under medium. It's quite dry with a low level of astringency. Well, I finished the bottle before I could accurately detect the level of creaminess. With it's 5.6% ABV, I'm feeling a little numbness in my face. I will open another bottle tomorrow to finish this. 
The level of creaminess is high. The carbonation is unique. The bubbles are tiny and tickle the tongue creating a effervescent quality. It has a lot of world class qualities in the mouth feel alone.
Overall, I'm amazed by how excellent this is. After trying a few beers that I didn't care for, Anchor Porter reminded me how truly great a beer can be."

4452,Anchor Porter,4.5,"Pours into hotel plastic cup like a stout, frothy tan head
Big tastes of coffee, chocolate and toffee/caramel for being light in abv. Finishes slightly dry. Delicious Union Made Beer to celebrate Labor Day"
4453,Anchor Porter,4.21,"Pours a very dark brownish color with a dark tan head. Smell is of chocolate and coffee, caramel, and malt. Taste is a nice chocolate-coffee and caramel. Good tasting Porter."
4454,Anchor Porter,4.17,The Porter is a dark beer and I got a two finger mocha head in a nonic. The roasty chocolate smell is inviting. The taste is roasty and finishes bitter. The solid mouthfeel bites back with the lingering bitterness. Overall an enjoyable porter.

4456,Anchor Porter,4.17,"From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This classic pours a dark blackish brown with 
a very nice head of khaki foam that settles to a thick ring, thin clumping layer,
and shows off some nice lacing. Nose of dark coffee, dark cocoa, moderate char, 
and roast with subtle dark fruit hints. Flavors hit the mark with dark fruit notes
of black and raspberry, dark cocoa, dark coffee, char, and balanced sweet 
caramel malts. Nice mouth feel; medium full body edging towards medium, 
smooth, lightly coating, light carbonation, and a balanced char and roast finish
that is lightly dry.

Overall---EXCELLENCE!

Cheers"

Mostly clear, pale gold colored body. One thin finger of white head sticks around. 
Aroma of oak, white wine and grape, and funk leather.
Taste is chardonnay grapes, oak, and leather/tobacco funk. Lower level of tartness. Really dries up in the aftertaste.
Very soft, medium plus mouth feel. Very dry finish. Very good carbonation.
Prominent Brett qualities along with the oak wine barrel influences. Terrific palate cleanser."
4466,Temptation,4.2,"Look: It pours golden and brilliantly clear with a white head. Head retention is low. 

Smell: It has a strong wine character from the chardonnay with some earthly flavors. There are some grape notes with a hint of leather. 

Taste: It has wine flavors with grapes. There are very low leather and earthen elements. There are some wood elements. 

Feel: It has a medium body with moderately strong sourness. 

Overall, this beer is quite wine like but not to the point where it drinks like a wine."
4467,Temptation,2.58,"Have to call it as I see it. Just a terrible beer. I’ve had others from Russian River and this should be removed from their offerings. Figure they would have something based on a wine being in the Napa area but just had no enjoyable qualities at all. Most scores from BA have been somewhat accurate but a 98 for this is just stunning. Don’t waste your time or money, IMO this score is completely way off base."
4468,Temptation,4.04,"Poured from 12.68 ounce bottle into a tulip glass.

Look- Pale gold, very hazy, no visible particulate, sudsy white head, below average head retention and lacing.

Smell- White grape, oak, chardonnay, mildly brett.

Taste- White grape, chardonnay, sour finish.

Feel- Thin body, clean finish, very dry finish, sourness induces saliva, gentle carbonation.

Overall- A wild ale with an abundance of chardonnay characteristics. This is a large descent from the beer styles I typically drink, but was an enjoyable new experience."
4469,Temptation,4.2,"A friend of mine visited Colorado for a family Christmas and he brought back a bunch of RR goodies 12-31-21 including this 375ml bottle for $14.99. Bottled 1-14-21; consumed 4-7-22.

Beer poured deep golden with a pretty good white head.

Nose is very nice, a nice combination of horse blanket, white wine, and a touch of sourness.

Taste follows the nose with a light but fairly substantial malt base that initially comes across as a sweet tart but has some funky leather. Finishes very dry and oaky.

Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth with each sip.

Overall a sour that is very well done and does not obliterate my sour sensitive palate!"

Pours an opaque pale gold with a finger of white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

Oh man, this is super funky in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy white wine, wet hay, old leather, sharp oak, lemon juice, pear, apple skin, and light white pepper

The funk really keeps up in taste, it’s soft and delicate up front yet tart and funky on the finish. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dry white wine, pear skin, white grape, smooth oak, and light apple. The swallow brings notes of earthy white wine, sharp oak, wet hay, clove, lemon juice, apple skin, and leather

A light medium body pairs with moderate tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes quite dry and funky

This one is very good, but the straight up funk holds it back just a little bit. Still, it’s masterfully done, and I can’t wait to try the rest"

4480,Rübæus,4.17,"Now, two twelve ounce brown bottles have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. It was a foamy pour. There's just way too much just-off-white and pinkish tinted foam to make this a pretty pour. Just as the norm, this foam recedes unevenly and unattractively. Only in this case, it's a slow process. The color of the liquid body beneath all the foam is something in the dark copper-amber or light mahogany category. It will leave irregular glass lacing. As ugly as it looks, there is a nice raspberry/malt aroma that makes this appealing. It's opaque without being murky. The taste is a very nice delivery of raspberry within a brew that includes some hops, yeast and even a little malt. It's sweet, but not bothersomely so, with a finish that bitters and drys things out. The mouthfeel is surprisingly wonderful, considering all the initial foam. With the hop bite finish, this may drink more like a raspberry AIPA than a fruited sour. Its body is also better than most fruited sours and more like a nice AIPA. Whatever, if you like a good dose of raspberry in your brew, this is a good option."

The mouthfeel is good, balanced nicely between sticky and watery, but a bit cloying and dry on the aftertaste, which in this case, is not a bad thing... it emulates actual raspberries. Overall, I'm impressed. If I were to design a beer to taste like a robust raspberry brew, I would want it to turn out like this. Damn good beer!"

Taste: Upfront it's slightly acidic with notes of cherry before immediately turning sweet with savory flavors of candied toffee and caramel. Midpalate some nice hints of cola and dark rum. Finishes sweet with gentle notes of nutmeg and very mild ginger. The use of spices are well restrained and tempered here and not in your face or extremely assertive which I appreciate.

Feel: Sticky and sweet. Somewhat syrupy but not overly so. Body is medium weight and carbonation level is low. Sugar level is moderately high imparting some weight to the beer.

Look: 
Dark but clear mahogany with ruby highlights. 2+"" creamy beige head. The head lasted for a very long time, leaving excellent lacing on the glass.

Taste: 
Very malty and somewhat sweet, though not bready. Toasted or burnt brown sugar/caramel. Very noticeable cherry notes. The spices from the aroma are here, along with some orange peel, though they are not dominant. The sharpness becomes a mild earthy bitterness here.

Pours a finger of tan head into my nitro glass. Retention is slightly below average, and the head fades somewhat quickly. Lacing is patchy, but not too bad. Body is a dark mahogany. Looks ok.

Nose is very sweet. Malty and a little spicy with notes of stone fruit and cherry. Smells pretty good, but certainly has potential to be overly sweet.

Flavor certainly has some stone fruit and cherry. Quite malty. Honestly, this is pretty good.

Carbonation is medium. Body is pretty light. Sweet, but not overly so, with a bit of tartness. Bitterness is low but not void. A solid mouthfeel.

Drinkability is great, this is tasty and pretty well balanced.

Overall a surprisingly good beer. Can’t pick up the added spices, but that’s probably a good thing."
4516,Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,4.22,"It's wonderful to pour the contents of two twelve ounce bottles into a clear glass liter mug and not be overwhelmed by stark white foam. Instead, there's a modest off-white head atop a bright and dark caramel colored brew. For all its color, there remains a translucent quality as well. In short, a fine looking beer. Caramel, malt and spices, which seem to include allspice, coriander and nutmeg provide the aroma. Thankfully, the malt and maybe an assist from molasses is the dominant taste, with the spices augmenting rather than dominating the flavor. Overall, this is malty and sweet, with a good caramel reference. While that may not be great press, it's so much better than the now overload of winter/holiday/Christmas ales that merely overly spice a not so good brew. The glass lacing, whilst not spectacular, does bear witness to each serving. The body may not be outstanding as a a barley malt based brew, but it far surpasses most beers that omit, or drastically reduce it. It's claim is that it's rich and sweet and it is, but not too much in either way."

4538,Negra Modelo,3.33,"From the back of the bottle, printed on glass with white ink spots: ""BB NOV 2023 C273B159 11:14.""

Appearance: The body is a medium shade of dark brown with light hints of golden brown and burnt umber. It is a dark beer but it has good clarity and ample carbonation bubbles are clearly visible. There is a medium-sized head which mostly has larger bubbles but there are smaller ones surrounding them. It has a tobacco-stained off-white head. The head retention is pretty good and it slowly fades out to a short cap. No real lacing.

Aroma: There is a light toasty caramel scent with a light nutty yeast note.

Taste: It has a light toasted caramel flavor up front. The middle of the palate has a bit of a bread character with a nutty flavor. It has a bit of a walnut and acorn character. Some pecan notes come through eventually too. A bit of alcohol develops after a few sips. The aftertaste is a light herbal bitterness.

Mouthfeel: It straddles the edge between light and medium bodied. It feels more medium as it first hits the palate but it doesn't have much texture when moving to the back. Carbonation feels high but good. There is a mild but noticeable bitterness.

Overall: The text on the label states that this is a ""Medium-bodied lager with slow-roasted caramel malts brewed for a rich, smooth taste."" That is a pretty fair description of the beer. The body feels a tad low but it is a nice beer to drink. It has a nutty flavor and aroma which gives the beer more depth as well. I probably wouldn't buy it regularly but it's an enjoyable beer."

Noticeable bitterness & hop aroma in the nose. 

Nice white head, good lacing throughout. 

As for the taste...where did the hops go?! They're in the nose but vanish on the tongue. Tastes very much like a lager to me. This has 3 months left on it's 'best before' date, so can't blame it on age. 

Watery, with no discernable flavor. A touch of bitterness on the back end, but hardly noticeable. After an interesting nose, this macro falls way flat."

4614,Hop Wallop,3.82,
4615,Hop Wallop,3.47,"Appearance:
Liquid gold. Pure, clean, and translucent. Looks like an ale you'd expect to see in the tavern of a great dwarven kingdom, just don't drink too deeply, or too greedily. Puffs up a layer of choppy white foam that disappears after introductions are over, living on only as a pattern of sticky, striated lacing.

Bouquet:
Floral, earthy notes but their aroma is dainty and distant, like flowers far away on a mountain. Traces of dried pine occasionally waft in on that far-off mountain breeze. Pleasant, but falls profoundly short of being impressive.

Feel:
A cold, babbling brook of bubbles cascade gently on this light-bodied ale. Crisp with a dry, tangy finish that promises to linger but ends up dipping out early.

Taste:
Bright, semi-sweet pine, quiet notes of pepper, and a wisp of lemongrass all stand before a crackery malt backbone.

Overall:
Meh? It’s pleasing, refreshing, and there's nothing wrong with it but it’s meek and doesn't add anything new to the genre. A serviceable, middle-of-the-road IPA that'll never stand out but sometimes that's just what the menu calls for."
4616,Hop Wallop,4.28,"Pours golden yellow with a 2 inch white head with good retention. Heavy lacing to end.

Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a semi-dark yellow branded color with some transparency about it. Some carbonation seem rising at a modest pace. Lace coats in a semi-dusty way but clingy.
The aroma had a strong citrusy pithy/bitter rind character strolling in for a balance with some bitter piney hop tones. Malts seem barely there.
The flavor leaned towards the bitter side with a touch of sweet pine dry needles arranging underneath. Mild pine tree aftertaste, fairly dry.
The mouthfeel was pretty dry running along my tongue. Holding it's own as its scraping like what I remember of old school IPA's/DIPA's. Sturdy carbonation and good for the style. Sure is a sipper. Finishes bitter through dry pine tree notes.dry
Overall, not for the faint of heart, this is what old school DIPA's seem to have started out as. This is one I would come back to preferably for me."
4620,IPA,3.74,
4621,IPA,3.78,"Pours a toasted golden color with a big rocky off-white head. Some soapy lacing on the glass.

A mix of floral and piney hops in the aroma. A little bit of bud and perhaps mint. Bright.

A light toasted malt. A bit heavier than most IPAs. The hops are earthy with light pine notes.

The malt is a beefy on the palate. Fairly balanced but finishes with a earthy bitterness.

Misses the mark on style. More of a hoppy APA. The malt is quite substantial. Its good though."

Aroma: Citrus, pine and grassy.

Flavor: Citrus, pine and grassy. Medium to low sweetness. Moderate bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Low Astringency, soft on the palate by finishes dry. Moderate length finish.

Overall: An iconic IPA out of GA. Initial aromas are of citrus (grapefruit-like) and pine; however, as it warms and aerates, you begin to pick up additional aromas, of which fresh cut grass was most noticeable. The tastes are just as complex. You get a nice malty sweetness intermixed with citrus, pine and herbs. None of which are powerful or offensive. It finishes semi-dry with a short, eloquent bitterness. Perfectly balanced and harmonized. Nothing boring or harsh in this IPA start to finish. One of my favorites."

Cloudy, deep gold colored body. One finger of lingering white, pillowy head. Not much left on the glass for lacing.
Aroma is grassy and muddy hops, with a sweet note from the maple syrup. Solid malt background.
Taste is grassy and piney hops, with a sweet note. Approaching a bitter note but not quite. Smooth trail off into the after taste. Allowing the beer to sit on the tongue really brings out the maple and hop combination.
Mouth feel is the best attribute of the beer, with dense coating and filling of the mouth. Very good carbonation.

That also describes the flavor, which is malty enough to provide a little sweetness and a decent body. The hops add flavor without being overly bitter. This is truly a wet hopped IPA. Earthy throughout the drinking experience, even the finish doesn’t approach the expected IPA hoppy dryness.

4699,Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.19,"Sierra Nevada came through with just what the beer Dr. ordered for my jangled nerves. I wholly appreciate how this dank herbal brew is kind of the opposite of so many IPAs on the scene here in the PNW. It has a pretty substantial caramel malty backbone that is distinctive like Rueben’s but less marmalade. The sweetness is mellowed by the bitterness, but it’s not too resinous, thick, but far from watery either. Somehow, this ABV is perfect for a nice buzz but way more sessionable than many IPAs out, maybe that’s a good thing if your planning a hangout outside with your buds. This herbal/malt profile also seems more aligned with this winter season so there’s another positive point. I did get this on tap so I’m not sure if I’d appreciate this as much if it sat around for more than a month and several weeks in the shelves. At this price, it would be hard to pass if I was looking to purchase a pony keg for the man cave"

Smells of huge hops but not one fruity flavor stands out. Usually doubles don’t have as much hop scent due to all the maltiness, but this thing is “mega” hopped—dry hopped big time I bet. I get sweet malty orange spicy hops. Wow. 

On the tongue piney, orange zest hops and cracker bread and toasted malts. Finishes fairly dry despite the thick, wet feel it hits you with. 

It’s big, it’s flavorful and it’s pretty amazing.

I loved this review by a real pro and amend mine with it:

By: Tracy Hensley lJudges Rating: 

Overall Impression: 
18 / 20

A consistent aroma blend of clean pine resin, pineapple syrup, freshly ripped mint and cracked black pepper lead the way in the front of the nose. From 8 inches away, Tahitian vanilla bean pods, baked whole wheat bread, low sulfur notes and white grape-like fruitiness also appear. The white head does not persist but does create a fine foam above a slightly hazy, golden appearance. Flavors start as intense dank pine extract and continues into the aftertaste where it is accompanied by sweetened white bread, which keeps the bitterness in check with a moderate, throat-coating alcoholic warmth. The second sip showcases tropical mango juice before pine again dominates as noticeable alcohol warmth and low motor oil elements come through. Full body and full fat creaminess coats the mouth, and the medium-high carbonation and moderate hop mouthfeel close out the finish while alcohol tingles on the lips.“"

4721,Hopsecutioner,3.94,"one of those beers of fame that i somehow have not had until now, a draft pour, an iconic beer, but it probably meant more when its peer group was smaller. the first thing ive had from terrapin in way too long, nice beer, but in some ways it has a ton of equals now, everyone caught up perhaps. looks like they used to, lightly brassy to copper, mostly clear with some low shine, a fine almost inch of thick and lasting white head, craggy and rocky and leaving lace as it drinks. it smells like minerals from the malt, a little crystal malt richness, but still american, tons of relatively fresh hops wrapped into it, grapefruit for sure, could be simcoe driven, spicy northwestern vibes too, orange zest, cantaloupe, and pine, its resinous and it seems to be bitter, but its not overly intense as they go, at least by todays standards, classically balanced and without anything from the yeast. the flavor is similar, grapefruit for sure, white pine boards, tangerine, herbal bitters, and actual high alpha hop bitterness set against, or rather alongside and together with, slightly nutty pale barley malt, sweet like toffee but for just a flash in the middle, then bready and baked and in a support role. this is really nice, fresh in this instance, and with some linger. it plays in that iconic space, lagunitas ipa and the like, drinkable for its strength and because its got great proportionality, but it also didnt hit me in this day and age as something real special either, good but just an ipa, not being critical, it just seems familiar. good to get to drink some terrapin stuff, i always forget they have corporate ownership now..."
4722,Hopsecutioner,3.88,"12 oz. can, best by DEC 07, 2023. Acquired the 6 pack from the Janesville, Wisconsin Woodman's. Ironic how beer brewed in Georgia is available in Wisconsin, yet I never see it in Illinois, but I digress.

A: Pours a nice burnt golden / orange, strong finger point five of frothy sudsy off-white head. Looks float-ish. Color is nice, reminiscent of how they used to make IPA's...
S: Earthy, twiggy, grassy. Not overly hoppy or piney or resinous, despite the six hop varieties that went into this. Notes of caramel & bready biscuit malt.
T: The taste is nice, but surely not designed to break or crash any new ground. Bitter, slightly piney, good balance of bread malts. It's simple but nice.
F: Decent feel. Smooth, creamy. Body feels super light, especially for being over 7% abv, with the alcohol being not noticeable at all.

Overall, I would call it slightly above average, but definitely decent, especially in these days where Hazy swill lines all the shelves.

Overall: WC style IPA. Lands with a compliment of citrus, herbal and piney aromas and flavors. Pretty aggressive bitterness that is coating and lasts well into the finish. Uses Warrior, Chinook, Simcoe, Centennial and Cascade hops."

Overall - Hoppy, malty backbone, caramel sweetness and fruity. Mouthfeel is a bit light. There's a piney resin and fruity candy flavor on the finish.

Aroma: Pine tar, the kind you'd put on a baseball bat. Some sweet notes of granola and orange peel in the background. A little bit of lemon peel and pickled ginger.

Taste: Decently bitter but not to a gobsmacking degree. Follows the nose. Good amount of pine resin and bitter orange upfront, followed by chewy notes of caramel and granola. Ends on more spicy pine resin with just the slightest hint of orange taffy. 

Feel: Mid-Heavy body. Somewhat chewy and thick. Dry.

The aroma is very complex with roasted coffee, dark crusty bread, and burnt sugar notes being complimented with a substantial herbal and spicy hop character. The taste has more of the same with a spicy, bittersweet chocolate finish. A very unique drinking experience by todays standards with the style moving away from bitter flavors and more into sweet flavors in most examples.

Dec 30, ‘20 bottling date - 6 months old. 
Much more like an English brown porter (aside from the bitterness) than most American porters. Roasty notes are low in favor of nutty, bready malts. 
There’s also a thread of that Chico yeastiness throughout. 
What saves it is the body: light and fizzy enough to be sessionable, but with a creaminess that makes it satisfying. 

A solid beer, but get Edmund Fitzgerald for that classic American Porter profile. 

Lighter, fizzier, sweeter, nuttier, more balanced, less hoppy, cleaner, and more sessionable than Sierra Nevada Stout."

Clear, translucent brown ale with two fingers fine tan head. Full head and lacing.
Roast malt, gingerbread, earthy yeast aromas explode out of the bottle.
Nutty sweet roast malt, light hop kick, light char, coffee flavors, deepening as the glass warms. A yeast flavor that I seem to experience in a number of Sierra Nevada beers.
Light hop bitterness, medium feel, lasting carbonation
Substantial depth of flavors in a 5 % ABV ale. Very pleasant."
4773,Porter,3.71,"Nice roasty malt up front with some sweet earthiness mixed in. It has a light mouthfeel with lots of carbonation and a mild bitter end. The finish drops off quickly - too quickly actually. It really is a nice porter, but overall it's too light, could be so much more."
4774,Porter,3.47,"Pours a dark coffee brown, ruby hues and a creamy tan head. Aromas are fairly muted, a roasted malt profile is there but I can’t really pick anything definitive. Flavors include roasty malt notes of coffee, raw cocoa and earthy nuttiness. Trademark SN floral hop bite makes a subtle appearance on the back end. Mild carbonation. Lingering bitterness on the palate.

It’s good for sure, not extraordinary or anything. As with any beer, freshness is everything. I would love to get some of this closer to the source to see the contrast in the flavors."

4779,Porter,4.1,"Look: Dark brown, almost black on the pour and deep ruby-red when held to light, with a frothy light tan head that settles slowly, leaving good lacing
Aroma: Roasted barley, chocolate notes, toasted nuts, warm brown bread, and some earthiness
Taste: Roast is the highlighted theme here. Tons of roasted barley, nuttiness, and even a light roasted coffee bean note hit hard up front and as those begin to subside, chocolate joins the mix. More roast goodness and earthy notes take hold and lead to the finish
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, smooth, medium-high carbonation, and smooth but slightly sharp on the finish from either the earthy hops or strong roast notes
Overall: This is tasty stuff. I hadn’t had this beer in almost two years as only one spot close to me has it in so when I saw bottles dated 10/9/20, I had to revisit and glad I did. A very well-made American porter with deep and rich malt flavors and enough earthy hops to keep it balanced. Throw in the very full body on this as well and you have yourself a winner. A classic and delicious to boot"

4789,Arctic Panzer Wolf,3.47,"From the bottom of the can: ""PKGD ON 11/18/22 Q0711""
This was a 16oz can from a 4-pack.

Appearance: The body is nearly opaque which allows only a very faint haze of a blurry shadow through. It has a deep golden amber body which is on the darker side but not quite bronze. There is a short and fluffy white head which maintains a thin layer of fluffy film over the surface with a creamy and fluffy ring around the glass. There is some spotty lacing.

Aroma: At first some wildflower aroma came through, then some fruity peach and grapefruit came to the nose. There is a touch of cabbage but each time it becomes apparent, it pops out and is replaced by a more fruity aroma.

Taste: The flavor closely mimics the aroma here. There is this somewhat floral opening to the beer giving it a wildflower note up front which is a bit soap-like. Then it develops more citrus character on the tongue; largely this mixture of pithy grapefruit and blood orange. These two citrus notes persist to the end. It has a somewhat grassy finish. After a while some candied orange also comes through a tad.

Mouthfeel: Bitterness on this beer is high. It has a body that is on the lower edge of medium with a touch of slickness. It is a bit of a slow drinker given the high bitterness and the somewhat medium body.

Overall: The citrus notes in this beer and the strong bitterness are the highlights. There is plenty to enjoy when it comes to both of these qualities. The beer also has a floral note which is not bad but when combined with the grassy character it clashes with the more citrus-centric notes of the beer. It's an alright beer but I'm not likely to buy it again over what is readily available on the market. The beer I purchased was consumed within 3 months of being canned so I might try it again if it was on tap or if it was fresher than the one I purchased. I wouldn't advocate for or against it, but I would recommend a single can or a sampler before buying a 4-pack."

Sweet cocoa flavor. Above average body, creamy on the initial sip, but a bit watery in the swallow. Odd. The carbonation is a bit on the low side. This Stout has no burnt bitterness.

It pairs well with artisan pizza, chicken Alfredo, grilled chicken, and it stands alone very well on a cool night under the stars or by the campfire. 

It is a filet-minoin or dessert stout... Something to savor, not a quaffable daily driver."

The taste is quite something - you get a big mix of flavors. You get hit with big dark chocolate note, followed inmediately by a big sweet flavor, vanilla and dark molasses mixed with some spices. Some hazelnut and syrupy caramel also.
The body is more light than dense, a little more creamy I would prefer. And not very carbonated, a little more would be better.

Flavor: Strong flavors of rich chocolate some Cany sugar gives a sweet Belgian chocolate and tongue tickle in the middle, before a rich and smooth chocolate finish. Malty and sweet, but then an uprising roasted bitterness ends up lingering. (4.00)

Feel: Heavier-bodied, average to stronger carbonation. Sweet, but then also an uprising of roasted bitterness that lingers. (4.00)

Compared to Bells Expedition Stout 2/2023: Pours similar, lighter head. Similar aromas. More bittersweet chocolate and coffee roast. Less thick and heavy chocolate with complex malt flavors of bread pudding and caramel. More bitter, roasted, and dry. 

Overall: A fantastic Russian Imperial Stout. As usual Great Lakes fashion this one packs together a great array of rich chocolate flavors with a rising roasted bitterness. Balance is the name of the game here, and it does it very nicely. 9.9% makes it feel like it's lighter, but make no mistake it's still 10% and incredibly and dangerously drinkable. (Rating: 4.05)"

Consumed on: 17 Nov, 2022
Glass: Snifter
ABV: 9.9%
Serving Temp: 54.8 F


Look: 
Deep and opaque black with a thin tan head. The head dissipates to a ring and a thin film over most of the beer. Lacing is good.

Smell: 
Very rich dark bittersweet chocolate with some notes of dark fruits in the background. Some char (which blends into the chocolate aromas) and faint notes of espresso and black licorice. Some earthy notes are in there as well.

Taste: 
Dark malts and chocolate start things off and then the dark fruits and some molasses (like blackstrap) take over for a short time. The sip really sweetens up with perhaps some brown sugar coming thru. Then the earthy notes and the somewhat bitter char take over, which help bring back some chocolate and also some dark roasted coffee. Things finish bittersweet and roasty and somewhat dry (for an Imperial Stout). The alcohol is fairly well hidden, though not completely.

Feel: 
Smooth and creamy with some warmth from the alcohol. The body is medium. With a slight lean towards medium-full.

Overall: 
A very good (Russian) Imperial Stout. Not overly bitter for the style, this tends towards the sweeter side but not overly much. Very drinkable, and perhaps dangerously so.

This beer has aged well over the 4 years that I have had it. I think that things have smoothed out over that time and blended quite nicely. What does seem to have suffered is the head/carbonation and the body (which is a tad light for my preferences for an RIS). But that's OK. I never found this beer to be overly hoppy/bitter when fresh, so I wasn't sure how it would handle this many years. I can say that it handled that time just fine."

4838,Blackout Stout,4.68,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.

Tastes of cherries with a dark chocolate and coffee finish. Absolutely amazing. Alcohol very well hidden.

Mouthfeel is crisp, yet very smooth, almost creamy, but also almost thin - a nice, balanced in-between. Incredibly enjoyable.

O: Haven't had this one since it was first released, before I was on BA, so it's nice to get to try it again. Takes me back to when session IPAs were the new toy on the shelf. To its credit, this one is bright and crisp, and would definitely do the job as a lawnmower beer.

Taste: More of that big, fierce and shining hop flavor, with just enough juicy malt below. Lean bodied, with a dominant buzz of hop bitterness. Drinkable, yes, also refreshing and tasty, too. It's good beer, and I can drink it, but…just doesn't thrill me. I really don't desire the session IPA. I like the regular ones just fine, thank you very much.

4889,Purple Haze,3.69,Love their TurboDog. Picked up a couple of sixers of this on sale for $6.29 at ABC. Lets give it a whirl. Popping the top I get faint malt wafts. Pours to a deep orange with a creamy off-white head that stands well. Taste is a nice raspberry pop up front then transitions into a malty middle then the bitterness builds in the end and leaves a clingy bitter aftertaste. Not sweet but more tart and bitter at the same time. A good fruity beer for those who still want some nice bitter hopping. I like the fact that it is not sweet and doesn't finish sweet.

4892,Purple Haze,3.24,"12 ounce well chilt bottle, straight up.
Smells like berries, but not in a lambic way. Boones Farm -ish.
Taste is a bit tart. The pilsner and wheat malts along with Vanguard hops give balance. Aftertaste is sweetly floral.,. nothing memorable here.,0
Thin, medium carb.
Overall, next time I got my gold & purple beads on, I’ll grab one of these little fruity lagers.,."
4893,Purple Haze,3.08,"DATE: April 14, 2023... OCCASION: watching A Sort of Homecoming with Shan and a beer I hadn't had in a long time.. GLASSWARE: Sam Adams custom lager... a hazy, dirty yellow body streams tiny bubbles upward into an off-white ring... the opening scents are metallic hops, raspberry, blueberry, Smarties chalk, and a strange, funky/yeasty annoyance that nonetheless gives it a unique, memorable aroma... slick, oily, watery--yet refreshingly so... some low-end effervescence at the throat... the strawberry and blueberry are punchy, bright and sweetly interwoven with its bready malts.... at 4% and change, crushable and embracing in its friendship... tough to argue with its effect, it might not be one worthy of an up-close profile, but it will win in the right context or gathering... a nice accompaniment for a warm spring night like this..."
4894,Purple Haze,3.19,
4895,Purple Haze,3.41,"Ok so it;s sorta pink - ish in color if back lit.
It's got a mild raspberry aroma under the malt. 
Hops may or may not have been used in the latter part of the boil. 
Most likely not but... maybe.
The flavor is light raspberry ale with a bit of actual malt sweetness to give it some ( not much ) body.
Finish is dry with a tart hint of red berry."

4923,Liberty Ale,3.5,"As always, my caveat: I rate the way I do on Untappd.

I was able to snag an Anchor variety pack that has Steam, California Lager, Tropical Haze and Liberty Ale.

As I understand beer history, this was one of the first craft IPAs released. It's a good beer, but unfortunately, by today's standards, it's barely a pale ale. Edited to add: According to Anchor's own web site: ""Now known as the first American Pale Ale and the beer that started the IPA movement"". 

Poured into my Sam Adams glass, deep gold. It's got a little bit of malt character, and a decent amount of hop bitterness, but this beer gets lost in the competition. There's nothing really remarkable about it."

I'm not a big fan of West coast IPAs.
Some are good. Most aren't.

Now to the Liberty Ale!

Poured a BEAUTIFUL color of a polished piece of amber. Lots of bubbles. Head stuck around for 5+ minutes. Nice lacing! Taste is strictly that Cascade Hops taste, not too bold but just enough to get that bitter mouthfeel. Nice carbonation! Not much of a lingering bitter aftertaste like I've experienced with some beers (Rebel Rouser, Ranger IPA, Torpedo). Definitely a nice, refreshing brew.

Overall I think it's a great beer for a hot day or a nice drawn out bbq."

4943,Dortmunder Gold,4.38,"Sampling a 12 oz bottle poured into my .5L dimple mug at cellar temp. 6/17/2023 date stamp on the label.
The beer pours a clear copper color with a few lazy streams of carbonation rising to the surface. There is a foaming soft eggshell white head of 2 cm. This foam fades quickly to a thin edge layer and leaves very scattered lattice when I take a sip or swirl the mug.
Aroma is a big of caramel and toasted bread with hints of biscuit as well. I do get some spicy hops and maybe tea note as well. Overall the nose is kind of mild but also complex. 
First sip reveals a light to medium body with smooth texture and gentle carbonation. Very easy drinker as would be expected for the beer and this style.
Flavor is toasted grains and biscuity malt with some spicy hop and black tea again, this lingers briefly after the swallow.
A nice easy drinking yet flavorful beer. Glad to have finally posted this review!"
4944,Dortmunder Gold,4.21,"On tap at Great Lakes

While visiting Cleveland for my first time, I couldn’t pasa up the opportunity to come to the legendary Great Lakes. And naturally I had to start off with the world’s highest rated Dortmunder Lager. Let’s see what it’s all about

Pours a mostly clear copper gold with 2 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose is gentle but very well balanced. I’m picking up on aromas of biscuity malt, earthy hops, black tea, black pepper, toffee, light honey, and raw grain

And it’s very similar in taste, but that’s fine by me. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting bready malt, black tea, herbal hops, toffee, raw grain, and light white pepper. The swallow brings notes of biscuity malt, herbal hops, toffee, black tea, black pepper, raw grain, and light orange zest

A light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness

This is damn solid. I haven’t had a Dortmunder in a while so I’m goad to have this one of all of them"
4945,Dortmunder Gold,3.44,"Great looking beer with little head staying power is about the best I can say about this brew. Now, it's not that the rest of it was bad, it was just mostly also-ran. I just found it to be a bit metallic tasting and the smell was just not there. Still, a decent brew, not one I will go out of my way for."
4946,Dortmunder Gold,4.1,"Pours a crystal-clear amber/gold with a thick white cap. Nice lacing. Aroma is roasted malt, biscuit, grassy hops. Flavor follows the nose, sweet up front with a bit of noble hop bitterness in the finish. Feel is medium bodied, with good carbonation. Overall, a fantastic beer."

4949,Dortmunder Gold,3.84,"5/1/23 Ford from a 12 oz can purchased from the Washington beer store.

Aroma is sweet malt right up front. Slight citrus as well. 

Taste is definitely lager. Sweet. Cracker. Dry hoppiness comes through."
4950,Dortmunder Gold,6.29,
4951,Dortmunder Gold,4.32,"Poured into a stein from a 12-oz can well within its date range.

Appearance: Dark golden, with a massive off-white head that dissipated gradually leaving nice lacing.

Nose: Pleasant toasted malt.

Mouthfeel: Medium, which was pleasantly heavier than I’d anticipated.

Attack: Plenty of malt, balanced with hop bitterness.

Finish: Hop bitterness lingers but doesn’t approach astringency.

This fine lager deserves every bit of its many awards and its #1 ranking in its style. True to style, heavier and more flavor intense than many lagers."
4952,Dortmunder Gold,4.34,
4953,Dortmunder Gold,4.43,"Pours a crystal-clear gold with a foamy white head and good lacing. Very bright herbal and hay like aroma, toasty cracker, and sweet bread dough. The taste is spicy, herbal and fresh, with a toasty/bready malt backbone, moderate body and clean, drying finish. Very flavorful and quaffable. I don't really know exactly what a Dortmunder-Style Lager is supposed to taste like, but this is world-class beer."

4969,Pliny The Younger,4.86,"I've been chasing this beer for the better part of 13 years. Today was finally the day. 500ml capped bottle into a Fuzzy IPA glass. 

Pours crystal clear goldenrod with a slowly building 2 finger foamy white head that sits around. Patchy, stringy lace sticks to the inside of the glass. Nose is citrus, pine, grass, and sap. Fresh, aggressive, resiny. Very pungent. Beer opens grass, pine, and citrus. Zesty towards the middle with loads of fresh pine, unripened tropical fruit, and tree sap. Finishes with a crystal clean bitterness that is dry and lingers in the aftertaste. Body is light to medium with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively on the palate, and goes down dry with a lingering, sticky aftertaste. 

I may be buying into the hype a bit after all this time but in a category that everyone in the world tries to do 10 times over, this is somehow the best of the bunch. A near perfect beer in every way. This juice is worth the squeeze."
4970,Pliny The Younger,4.68,Bucket list beer. Pretty darn good.

4984,Troegenator,3.9,"12oz bottle, best by 8.21.23

Poured at fridge temp into a tulip glass

Pours a deep coppery brown (and crystal clear clarity) with a 2 finger tan head. Quickly settled into a fair ring and loose cap. 4

Off the bottle I get lots of dark but fresh/ripe stonefruit, mostly plum, fig but also something brighter and sweeter... Dates maybe? Whatever it is it's awesome! 4

Chocolate malt is clear and gentle, deep ripe plum, and toasted grain. Slight alcohol warmth, but it's barely perceptible. 3.75

Full and chewy body, but not syrupy or too thick. Carbo is moderate and lingering grain + stonefruit is great. 4

Overall a delightful and well rounded/crafted beer, enjoyable warm or cold. 4"
4985,Troegenator,3.94,"Tastes like a classic double bock. But is flat and should have much more foam and carbonization.

4986,Troegenator,4.11,"Drank 2 for this rating, one warmed for a few minutes and one straight from the fridge

Pours somewhere between copper and amber, slightly hazy with a quickly dissipating 3.5 finger khaki head

Smells upfront mildly of hops and definitely of malt, maybe a tiny bit of lemon?

Tastes very sweet initially, followed by caramel, with an aftertaste of dried fruit, with very little bitterness throughout. I notice more bitterness the more I drink, but it still remains very low. I still taste the caramel notes. During the second bottle I began tasting toast and bread, very good malt tastes in this beer.

This is extremely smooth, likely the smoothest non stout/porter I've had

Absolutely willing to buy this again as a 6 pack, which is how I bought this, to celebrate German beer day. Price was decent so that's another thing in it's favor"
